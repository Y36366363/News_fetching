    "content": "February 18, 2026 12:45 ET | Source: Eramet SA Eramet SA Eramet: structural measures to strengthen balance sheet and prepare the future, after a challenging year 2025 In 2025, global macroeconomic headwinds and core commodities at cyclical lows combined with the weakening of the dollar weighed on the Group’s profitability and cash generation, while our operational performance did not meet our objectives across all operations. However, we reached several key decisive milestones of our strategic roadmap, notably the ramp-up of our lithium production in Centenario. This is an achievement the Eramet team can be proud of, positioning our Group at the heart of the energy transition with a world-class asset. Our achievement in early 2026 of the IRMA 50 performance level by our mineral sands mine in Senegal also marks a major milestone in the Group’s Act for Positive Mining vision. In 2026, our priority is to remain focused on improving our operational performance, controlling our costs and investments, with a particular attention to safety. The ReSolution programme provides a rigorous execution framework for these actions, leveraging our world-class assets. We have also launched other structural actions, aimed at strengthening our balance sheet, with the full support of the Board of Directors, including a strategic review with asset monetisation options in 2026, as well as a planned equity base strengthening. During this transition, I know I can count on the commitment of all our teams. In response to a deteriorated financial situation, and with the support of its Board of Directors, Eramet has implemented a funding plan aimed at improving cash generation and strengthening the balance sheet. This plan aims to enable the normalisation of the Group’s credit ratios (gearing and leverage), while securing its liquidity and access to the bond market. In the medium term, this enhanced financial flexibility will enable Eramet to seize new growth opportunities. The funding plan is built on three pillars: The plan includes measures taken to preserve liquidity during its roll-out: The Group is committed to a strict capital allocation approach, with deleveraging as a priority, targeted investments, and suspension of dividend payments for the next two years. The representatives of the reference shareholders approved this plan at the Board of Directors meeting on February 18 th , 2026, and committed to vote in favour of the resolutions necessary for its implementation. Eramet will submit the appropriate resolutions at its next Annual General Meeting, in May 2026. Re S olution, the Group’s performance improvement programme In December 2025, Eramet announced the launch of “ReSolution”, a programme of actions designed to improve its performance, unlock value and fully realise the potential of its world-class asset portfolio. This programme provides a clear framework and rigorous methodology to drive the performance improvement initiatives and ensure their proper execution. The programme is structured around three pillars: The ReSolution programme aims to deliver an initial run rate EBITDA 1 improvement potential of €130-170m within two years (at 2025 economic conditions), with full impact expected in 2028. The programme also targets stringent capex discipline, with a positive impact on the Group’s FCF. Capex is thus expected to decrease by approximately 30 to 40% in 2026 (vs. 2025). The Group’s safety performance remains in line with the CSR roadmap, as the TRIFR 6 stood at 0.8 for the year, below the limit set for 2025 (<1.0). However, Eramet mourns three fatal accidents that occurred at PT Weda Bay Nickel (“PT WBN”) during the year, as well as the death of a PT WBN subcontractor in January 2026 during a maintenance operation. The Group immediately implemented targeted safety action plans, in conjunction with the majority partner of the Indonesian JV. The safety of employees and subcontractors remains Eramet’s top priority and Pillar 1 of the ReSolution programme – “Safety and positive mining” is critical. Its target is to record “zero injuries and High Potential Incidents (‘HPIs’)” while improving risk management processes. In 2025, the Group’s overall performance for the “ Act for Positive Mining ” roadmap amounted to 105% versus the annual target (see Appendix 8), despite a safety performance at 0, due to PT WBN. There were several notable areas of progress: Achieving the IRMA 50 performance level for Eramet Grande Côte (“EGC”) and the publication of EGC’s first external third-party audit report in February 2026 represent a key milestone towards delivering the Group’s Positive Mining strategy. This confirms the relevance of the IRMA standard as a framework for progress and transparency, as well as its credibility among stakeholders. EGC thus becomes the first mineral sands mine to reach this score and joins the 14 mining sites worldwide which have completed an IRMA independent audit 8 . Three additional Eramet sites are currently engaged in the IRMA self-assessment process. The PT WBN, Eramine and Comilog sites are preparing to enter the independent audit process, which is expected to begin for some of them by the end of 2026. The SLB maturing in 2028 include two decarbonisation targets, with a coupon step-up in the event of not meeting one of the intermediate targets. In this context, the intermediate target for the Group’s carbon intensity (scope 1 and 2) was not met in 2025 (0.267 tCO₂/t measured vs. 0.227 tCO₂/t expected). This is explained by the increase of the relative share of alloy volumes in the Group's total production. The intermediate target related to the value chain engagement was exceeded (72% measured vs. 67% expected). As a result, a 5 basis point penalty will be paid on the 2027 and 2028 coupon. In 2025, Eramet maintained its A- score for the CDP Climate Change rating and obtained an A- score for the CDP Water Security rating, a significant improvement vs. 2024 (B). This result reflects Group-wide efforts across all sites to improve water management: increasing data reliability, developing water balance sheets for all sites, and gradually aligning water management plans with major international standards (IRMA, ICMM 9 ). This recognition places Eramet among the most advanced companies in terms of environmental transparency, out of nearly 20,000 companies assessed globally in 2025. Eramet's long-term credit ratings are B1 at Moody's and B at Fitch, both with negative outlooks. These ratings reflect the unfavourable commodity market environment, operational difficulties and balance sheet pressures, as well as country risk-related rating ceilings. Eramet's Board of Directors met on 18 February 2026, chaired by Christel Bories, and approved the financial statements for the 2025 financial year which will be submitted for approval at the Shareholders’ General Meeting on 27 May 2026 10 . 1 Data rounded to the nearest million or to higher or lower %. 2 Effective from 2024, the Group’s key performance indicators are presented excluding SLN, since the New Caledonian entity no longer impacts the Group’s financial and economic performance. Reconciliation tables in accordance with IFRS accounts are presented in Appendix 1. Definitions are provided in the financial glossary in Appendix 10. 3 Net of Tsingshan’s capital contributions to the Centenario project (€104m in 2024) and financing granted by the French State to SLN as a quasi-equity instrument (€257m in 2024, including interest accrued over the period, and €242m in 2025). 4 Restated for SLN’s net cash position on 31 December 2025 (€111m); as a result, consolidated net debt was €2,046m in the calculation of adjusted leverage. 5 Net debt-to-Shareholders’ equity ratio, excluding IFRS 16 impact. 6 Total shareholders' equity, net financial debt, site restoration provisions, restructuring and other social risks, less long-term investments, excluding PT WBN capital employed. N.B.: all the commented changes in FY 2025 are calculated with respect to FY 2024, unless otherwise specified. “H1” corresponds to the first half of the year, “H2” to the second half and “Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4” to the quarters. The Group’s Adjusted turnover 1 amounted to €3,155m in 2025, down 7% from 2024. Adjusted for an unfavourable currency effect (-3%), the variation at constant scope and exchange rates 11 came out at -3% 12 , primarily due to an unfavourable price impact (-4%) 13 , which was partly offset by a positive volume effect (+2%) 14 . Adjusted EBITDA 1 amounted to € 372m , down 54%, reflecting: Net income, Group share, for the year was -€477m, including the share of income in PT WBN (€58m) and losses related to SLN (-€107m). Net income, Group share (excluding SLN) 1 totalled -€370m , mainly resulting from the decline in EBITDA and the limited contribution of PT WBN, as well as an asset impairment charge for the mineral sands activity (-€171m) – mainly linked to the weaker long-term price outlook in this market. Capex financed by the Group 15 amounted to €412m, down -17% vs. 2024, and include €235m in non-current investments, primarily in Argentina (€96m) and Gabon (€99m). Adjusted Free Cash-Flow 1 (“Adjusted FCF”) totalled -€481m . It includes the dividends received from PT WBN of €34m (in line with the strong decline in EBITDA), as well as tax disbursements of €137m, including €80m paid to the Gabonese State – corresponding, on the one hand, to the corporate tax balance for 2024, and on the other, to a tax adjustment for 2019-2022. The “Cash Boost” programme, focused primarily on capex reduction, working capital optimization, and monetisation of CO₂ allowances in Norway, generated a one-off impact of €103m on FCF in 2025. Under the SLN financing agreement signed with Eramet, the French State subscribed to €138m of undated fixed rate subordinated bonds (Titres Subordonnés à Durée Indéterminée – “TSDI”) at end-2024 to fund SLN’s cash needs in 2025. The French State has since subscribed €215m in additional “TSDI” (including €115m in December 2025), increasing total financing received to €353m to ensure financing for SLN in 2025 as well as the first part of 2026. The Group’s net debt was €1,935m on 31 December 2025, after disbursement related to dividends paid to Eramet’s shareholders (-€43m) and Comilog minority shareholders (-€55m) in respect of 2024. Restated for SLN’s net cash position on 31 December 2025 (€111m), the Group’s net debt was €2,046m. As a result, the Adjusted leverage ratio 1 was 5.5x . As of 31 December 2025, Eramet’s liquidity , including entirely drawn credit lines at end-January 2026, was €1.5bn . No dividend payment will be proposed for 2025. While the SLN’s financial needs will once again be covered by the French State in 2026, a minority shareholder has expressed its intention to exit SLN’s capital and has requested Eramet to acquire its 10% stake for a symbolic amount in the coming weeks. Eramet has responded favourably to this request, which does not impact the Group’s economic exposure. This transaction is designed to preserve maximum flexibility as part of the work on SLN’s future. 1 Data rounded to the nearest million or to higher or lower %. 2 See definition in the financial glossary in Appendix 10. EBITDA for the Manganese activity was €357m in 2025, (-37% vs. 2024): 1 Turnover linked to external sales of manganese ore only, including €72m linked to Setrag transport activity other than Comilog's ore (vs. €66m in 2024). 2 Includes €52m linked to Setrag transport activity other than Comilog’s ore (€43m in 2024). 3 Definition updated (see financial glossary in Appendix 10), now excluding mining taxes and royalties (non-controllable), which account for 6% of FOB turnover. Global production of carbon steel , the main end-product for manganese, was 1,849 Mt in 2025, down 2% from 2024. China, which accounts for more than half of global steel production, posted a year-on-year decline of 4%, ending at its lowest level since 2018. Conversely, India continued to see an increase in production (+10%), which was also the case in North America (+2%), benefitting from the protectionist measures introduced. Europe posted a further decline of 4%, faced with continued declining demand and continuing pressure from imports. Manganese ore consumption for 2025 was up by 7% to reach 20.6 Mt-Mn, driven by demand for global manganese alloys production, particularly in China. However, with local steel production at its lowest level, this translated into higher levels of manganese alloy inventories among Chinese producers. Manganese ore production increased to 20.8 Mt-Mn (+7%), strongly increasing in H2 (+12% vs. H1 2025). Production from South Africa (still accounting for nearly 50% of seaborne production) was significantly up over the year (+7%). In Gabon, volumes were stable over the year, in line with Comilog volumes. In Australia, volumes, which increased sharply, normalised in H2 (x4 vs. H1 2025), following the resumption of exports by a major producer. As a result, the manganese ore supply/demand balance was in slight surplus over the year. Chinese port ore inventories remained at 4.6 Mt at end-December (stable vs. end-September), equivalent to 8 weeks of consumption. In 2025, the price index (CRU) for manganese ore (CIF China 44%) averaged $4.5/dmtu, down 18% from 2024. This trend reflects unfavourable comparatives, given the strong price increases between April and June 2024. Prices slightly rebounded in Q4 2025, rflecting stronger demand from manganese alloy production in China. The price index (CRU) for refined alloys in Europe (MC Ferromanganese) declined by 10%, while the price index for standard alloys (Silicomanganese) was down by 8%. Nonetheless, manganese alloys prices in European markets rebounded in December following the formal adoption of safeguard measures by the European Union. In Gabon, the operational performance was heavily impacted in 2025 by logistics and operational challenges at the port of Owendo in H1 and on the rail network. Against this backdrop, volumes for manganese ore transported and sold externally came out to 6.1 Mt and 5.5 Mt respectively, representing stable levels vs. 2024, a year marked by historically low volumes. Rail transport remains one of the main bottlenecks in the logistics chain, highlighting the strategic importance of the ongoing investment programme to renovate and modernise the Transgabonese railway. In parallel, production at the Moanda mine was up 4% to 7.1 Mt. FOB cash cost 2 for manganese ore activity was $2.4/dmtu over the year (+9% vs. 2024). This increase mainly reflects rising production costs, notably linked to the heavier reliance on a local logistics partner, higher maintenance costs, as well as an unfavourable €/$ exchange rate. Mining taxes and royalties (paid to the Gabonese State) stood at $0.2/dmtu in 2025 (stable vs. 2024). Conversely, sea transport costs per tonne were down to $0.7/dmtu (-31%). Manganese alloys production totalled 653 kt in 2025, up 3%, reflecting the restart of production at Dunkirk smelter following the refurbishment of the furnace. Manganese alloys sales slightly increased (+1%), albeit with a less favourable product mix (52% of refined alloys). The manganese alloys margin considerably eroded over the year due to the significant decline in selling prices (particularly in the United States) and the increase in the cost of reductants, while the decline in the price of manganese ore consumed only provided marginal respite. In July 2025, Norway’s Ministry for Climate and the Environment ruled in favour of Norwegian manganese alloys producers, including Eramet Norway, regarding unfair treatment in the allocation of free emission allowances under the EU ETS for the 2021-2025 period. Additional CO 2 emission allowances were thus allocated to Eramet Norway for this period, enabling the one-off sale of allowances with a positive impact of €46m on alloys EBITDA in 2025, as part of the Cash Boost programme. Global carbon steel production is expected to moderately increase in 2026, with a less significant decline in Chinese production than in 2025, positively offset by an increase for the rest of the world – particularly in India where Eramet has a strong business footprint. Demand for manganese ore should decline in 2026, with the robust Indian production not sufficient to offset an anticipated decrease in alloys production in China. Manganese ore supply is expected to increase with lower comparatives in 2025, during which a major producer only resumed exports in May. The market consensus, which is currently set around $4.8/dmtu 19 on average for 2026, with a lower H1 than H2, reflecting an increase of close to 6% in the manganese ore price index (CIF China 44%) compared with 2025. Demand for alloys is expected to increase slightly outside of China, in line with the growth in steel production. After a year disrupted by logistics challenges, transported manganese ore volumes are expected to be between 6.4 and 6.8 Mt in 2026. This increase will be delivered by ongoing railway renovation works and operational performance improvement actions spearheaded under the ReSolution programme. These actions serve to debottleneck transport capacity by optimising traffic, increasing the number of carriages per train and optimising maintenance. These initiatives will be supported by investments estimated at around €160m in 2026, of which around €70m related to logistics improvements. FOB cash cost 2 is expected between $2.4 and 2.6/dmtu in 2026, with the favourable effect of a volume increase largely offset by an unfavourable €/$ currency effect 20 . Following the announcement in 2025 by the Gabonese authorities of the intention to transform more ore locally, Eramet continues to conduct studies and discussions with the authorities regarding ore processing and value creation options in a robust win-win partnership approach. The objective is to swiftly establish a joint roadmap with the authorities that will enable value creation by contributing to Gabon’s industrial development as well as the viability of the associated economic ecosystem. Manganese alloys sales are expected to remain stable over the year. Adjusted EBITDA (excluding SLN) 1 for the Nickel activity amounted to €95m in 2025 (-64% vs. 2024). PT WBN’s share of EBITDA (excluding the off-take contract) came to €102m (-62%), penalised by a less favourable product mix, the significant decline in the ore grade (-20%) and rising production costs. This decline was partly offset by significant premiums on the reference price (higher than 70% for saprolite). 1 Excluding NPI off-take. 2 Supervision costs for the Indonesian entity. Global stainless-steel production , which is the largest end-market for nickel, increased by 2% to 62.6 Mt in 2025. Production in China, which accounts for more than 60% of the global supply, also saw year-on-year growth of 2%, still driven by exports and domestic consumption. In Indonesia and the rest of the world, production was up 1%. Global demand for primary nickel increased by 4% to 3.5 Mt-Ni in 2025, driven both by the stainless-steel sector (65% for existing demand) and the batteries sector. Global primary nickel production was up 6%, reaching 3.7 Mt-Ni. Growth in the NPI 22 supply (+14%) and the ramp-up in new projects, notably HPAL 23 (+50%) in Indonesia, were partly offset by the decline in NPI production in China (-19%) as well as traditional ferronickel production (-5%). The supply/demand balance (class I and II 24 ) remained in surplus in 2025. Visible nickel inventories at the LME and SHFE 25 increased in Q4 to 301 kt-Ni at end-December, equivalent to around 5 weeks of consumption. In 2025, the LME price average (price of part of class I nickel) was $15,159/t, down 10% year-on-year, reflecting a market still in surplus. Conversely, prices significantly rebounded at end-December, in connection with a potential restriction on 2026 production and sales permits in Indonesia, the global-leading producer of nickel. The average for the NPI price index 26 as sold at Weda Bay was $11,663/t, down by 3%. In Indonesia, the official domestic price index for high-grade nickel ore (“HPM Nickel” 27 ) averaged $27/wmt for a grade of 1.6% 28 in 2025, declining by 10% (in line with nickel price trends at the LME). Considering the Indonesian government’s restrictions on permits, domestic nickel ore supply remained under pressure. As a result, premiums on top of the base HPM index price were sustained at a high level for saprolite (above 70% over the year). In Indonesia , following an upward adjustment of the RKAB 29 in July 2025, nickel external ore sales 30 totalled 38.5 Mwmt over the year, up by 27%. However, this increase was accompanied by a less favourable product mix. Saprolite volumes sold accounted for 64% of the total, at 25.5 Mwmt, declining 11% year-on-year. To quickly market the volumes authorised by the revised RKAB, low-grade saprolite was sold as a supplement to higher-grade saprolite, thereby weighing on the average grade (averaging around -13%). Limonite volumes represented 34% of the total, at 13.1 Mwmt (x7 vs. 2024), driven by growing demand from HPAL plants in the IWIP industrial park. Internal consumption for the PT WBN NPI plant reached 3.4 Mwmt in 2025. PT WBN continued to benefit from significant premiums (more than 70% over the year vs. the HPM Nickel index) for its high-grade saprolite selling prices, against the background of domestic supply restrictions. Parallel to this, production costs at the mine increased, reflecting lower productivity (notably, an increase in the strip ratio) and longer haulage distance. This was compounded by the increase in royalties, effective from April 2025. Production at the PT WBN NPI plant increased by 17% over the year to 35.8 kt-Ni. As part of the off-take contract (trading activity), NPI sales stood at 15.8 kt-Ni, up 27%. PT WBN’s contribution to Group FCF was limited to €34m in dividends paid in 2025. This low contribution can be attributed to the substantial decline in EBITDA, amplified by a calendar effect tied to year-end sales (14.3 Mwmt over November and December, representing 37% of annual volumes), which will be collected in early 2026. Demand for primary nickel is expected to grow at a brisker pace in 2026 (+5%), notably driven by the development of stainless-steel production in China, India and Indonesia. Nickel consumption by the batteries sector should also accelerate. Primary nickel production is expected to increase by 4%, particularly with rising NPI production in Indonesia, ferronickel and with MHP production stepped up for HPAL projects. However, the potential reduction of mining permits in Indonesia could reverse this trend and significantly impact production levels in 2026. The nickel market started FY 2026 in surplus but could gradually rebalance depending on Indonesia’s strategy. For 2026, the market consensus for LME nickel prices currently stands at around $15,750/t 19 , representing an increase of around 4% vs. 2025. In early February, PT WBN received an initial notification from the Indonesian authorities to submit a RKAB application for an annual production and sales volume of 12 Mwmt of nickel ore in 2026 (including 3 Mwmt of internal sales). While remaining supportive of the market rebalancing policy pursued by the Indonesian authorities, PT WBN plans to submit as early as possible a request for an upward revision of this quota, which represents a disproportionate reduction for PT WBN. The initial RKAB granted in 2025 was 32 Mwmt and was subsequently revised upward to 42 Mwmt in mid-July. PT WBN will for now begin the preparation of this new RKAB and assess, together with local authorities, its subcontractors, customers and other local stakeholders, the necessary adaptations to its mining operations in response to this materially lower production level. Unit production costs per tonne of ore could increase compared to 2025, subject to authorised volumes and mining plan adjustment costs. In this context of increasing pressure on local ore supply, the ore price premiums from which PT WBN benefits vs. the HPM Nickel reference price index, as well as the index itself, are expected to further increase compared to 2025, particularly in H1 if a structural shortage of ore emerges. Despite higher HMC production, EBITDA for the Mineral sands activity was €78m in 2025 (down 35% vs. 2024), penalised by a decline in prices which was especially significant in H2. The zircon market remained in oversupply in 2025. Global demand decreased throughout 2025, impacted by macroeconomic uncertainty and the weakness of real estate activity around the world, particularly in China. In parallel, production over the year did not adjust sufficiently, notably owing to increased volumes of heavy mineral concentrates imported into China. Against the backdrop of persistent oversupply and the lack of prospects for a demand recovery in the short term, prices continued declining in Q4, leading some producers to reduce or cut their production. As a result, in 2025, zircon premium prices averaged $1,668/t FOB, down 12% vs. 2024 (-8% in Q4 vs. Q3 2025). Global demand for TiO 2 pigments 32 , the main end-market for titanium-based mineral products 33 , was down over the year, also penalised by macroeconomic uncertainty and a widespread slowdown in consumption. At the same time, supply was only partly revised downwards, sustaining a surplus which significantly weighed on prices. The market price for ilmenite (chloride), as produced by Eramet Grande Côte (“EGC”) was $274/t FOB in 2025, down 8%, factoring in China’s increased ilmenite supply. In Senegal, EGC operations posted a solid operational performance for 2025. Mineral sands production achieved a record level, at 983 kt-HMC 34 , up 11% from 2024, driven by a significant improvement in average grade in the mined area as well as productivity gains delivered by the supplementary dry mining unit. Consequently, ilmenite production volumes increased by 8% over the year, to 617 kt, while ilmenite sales were up 4%, to 584 kt. Similarly, zircon production increased by 5% year-on-year to 71 kt. Zircon sales totalled 65 kt, slightly down by 2%, owing to the postponement of certain shipments to 2026. Demand for zircon and ilmenite is expected at best to recover only slightly in 2026. Zircon production cuts and reductions implemented in late 2025 could enable price stabilization for this product in 2026 at Q4 2025 levels. In parallel, ilmenite supply would remain in surplus given the ramp-up of new projects, with average price levels lower in 2026 compared to 2025. In Senegal, mineral sands production in 2026 is expected to be above 900 kt-HMC. The increase in the volume of sand processed and the productivity gains achieved under the ReSolution programme through the optimisation of the separation plant yield should offset the anticipated decline in the grade in 2026, in line with the mining plan. Investments are underway to finalise an increase in production capacity and support the decarbonation of operations. A final tranche of around €30m is expected in 2026. EBITDA for the Lithium activity was -€51m in 2025, in the context of a delayed ramp-up in H1, before achieving capacity and output close to 75% of design capacity in December in only seven months of ramp-up. 2025 enabled the Group to reach two landmark milestones: confirmation of the industrial efficiency of the Direct Lithium Extraction (“DLE”) technology developed by Eramet and the commissioning of the entire lithium carbonate production process. In 2025, global electric vehicle (“EV”) sales were up 20% year-on-year. In China, sales increased by 17% with a sales penetration rate of 49% (+6 pts). Europe also posted a solid performance with a 33% increase in sales and an annual penetration rate of 28% (+6 pts). The United States saw modest growth at 1% over the year, with a stable penetration rate (10%), owing to the abolition of the tax credit to purchase electric vehicles, which was reflected in a slump in fourth-quarter sales. Installations of stationary energy storage systems (“ESS”) considerably increased in 2025 (+49%), driving cell production. Consequently, demand for lithium was significantly up over the year, reaching 1,533 kt-LCE in 2025 (+31%). Parallel to this, lithium supply amounted to 1,558 kt-LCE (+18% vs. 2024), driven by the ramp-up in new spodumene mines (notably in Australia and Mali) and increased brine based production in Argentina. In China, with the notable exception of CATL's Jianxiawo mine, which was subject to intense speculation of a restart in Q4, all players affected by mining permit compliance issues appear to be continuing to operate as normal. As a result, the Lithium market shifted from significant surplus to near-breakeven in 2025, owing to sharply accelerating year-end demand. The SMM battery-grade index (Ex-Works, China) averaged $9,342/t-LCE in 2025, down 17%. However, the index rose by 20% in Q4 from Q3 2025, reflecting a rebalancing of the market at-end 2025. In Argentina, Eramet’s Centenario plant ramped up its lithium carbonate production. On the back of an H1 hampered by a technical issue during the commissioning of the Forced Evaporation equipment, production was substantially up throughout H2, reaching close to 75% of its daily nameplate capacity in December, vs. 10% in June. Lithium carbonate production volumes totalled 6,690 t-LCE in 2025 (of which 5,980 t-LCE in H2). Given the priority given to ramping up production and the low price premium observed in the market, Eramet has decided to currently produce only limited quantities of battery grade, as the discount remains low compared to the cost savings. Volumes sold reached 5,420 t-LCE (of which 4,900 t-LCE in H2) and were made primarily to CAM producers in China. In 2025, the plant’s construction capex amounted to €96m. Growth in demand for lithium is expected to be driven by the continued adoption of electric vehicles worldwide. In China, the sales penetration rate should reach 60% in 2026, despite the gradual reduction in subsidies. In Europe, the 30% threshold is expected to be met. This momentum is propelled by the launch of 100% electric and plug-in hybrid models that are accessible to the general public, as well as the continuation of subsidies. Growth in demand for lithium is also expected to be driven by the wide-scale deployment of ESS. China should remain the market leader, followed by the United States, Europe and the Middle East. The robust development of this technology is expected to boost demand for LFP chemical cathodes. The price decline observed until end-June 2025 forced several lithium rock concentrate producers to cut or even halt their production, temporarily reducing the market supply. The market consensus (battery-grade CIF Asia lithium carbonate) currently averages around $15,700/t-LCE 19 in 2026, up close to 70% vs. 2025. In 2026, the Centenario plant will continue its ramp-up, reaching a level close to 100% by year-end (24 kt-LCE a year). As a result, produced volumes of lithium carbonate are expected to total between 17 and 20 kt-LCE over the year. Parallel to this, and under the ReSolution programme, actions were taken to optimise cash cost, particularly by limiting input cost through improved reagent consumption. Within two years (2026-2027), the cash cost (Ex-Works, at nameplate capacity) is expected to be between $5,400 and $5,800/t-LCE (based on 2025 economic conditions), still firmly positioned in the first quartile of the cost curve. Eramet continues to explore its development options for Centenario, with the salar’s overall production potential estimated at more than 75 kt-LCE per annum. As a first step, Eramet is actively studying options to expand the existing plant, located at the southern end of the salar, and retains a future option to build a new plant at the northern end of the salar. The Group is also assessing potential partnerships and strategic lithium development projects that would enable to leverage its now-demonstrated technical expertise. This growth strategy is designed to align with the Group’s priority being to pursue a deleveraging path while once more unlocking positive cash generation. At the start of 2026, the macroeconomic uncertainties that weighed on demand across our markets in 2025 are being mitigated by favourable pricing conditions, with the exception of mineral sands. The price consensus 36 and exchange rate 37 for 2026 currently stand at: To reduce its foreign exchange risk exposure, the Group has implemented hedging on its EUR/USD exposure. This covers approximately two-thirds of its annual exposure and is in line with current Bloomberg consensus for 2026. In 2026, manganese alloys selling prices are expected to face high volatility given the European Union's Safeguard measures and protectionist measures in the United States. Domestic prices for nickel ore sold in Indonesia, which are indexed to the LME and change accordingly, should continue to benefit from increased premiums versus 2025, supported by the context tension on Indonesian ore supply. Sensitivities of adjusted EBITDA (excl. SLN) to the price of metals and to the exchange rate are presented in Appendix 6. In 2026, freight rates are expected to be at levels comparable to or slightly higher than those observed in 2025, fuelled by rising demand combined with limited growth in supply. Energy costs should decrease in 2026, while reductants should increase slightly. The ReSolution programme sets a framework aimed at delivering a run rate EBITDA improvement potential of €130-170m within two years (at 2025 economic conditions), with full impact expected in 2028. Most of this potential comes from the manganese ore activity, notably from expected volume growth. It does not include the lithium production ramp-up and does not cover Weda Bay. 1 Definitions in the financial glossary in Appendix 10. 2 For an exchange rate of $/€1.20. The capex amount 4 is expected to be between €250m and €290m in 2026. 19.02.2026: Presentation of 2025 annual results A live Internet webcast of the 2025 annual results presentation will take place on Thursday 19 February 2026 at 9:30 a.m. (Paris time), on our website: www.eramet.com.

Appendix 6: Sensitivities of Group adjusted EBITDA (excluding SLN) 1 For an exchange rate of $/€1.20 2 Sensitivity calculated taking into account the EUR/USD hedging implemented for 2026 Consolidated performance indicators – Income statement Consolidated performance indicators – Net financial debt flow table Consolidated performance indicators – Balance sheet Appendix 8: Targets for the new Act for Positive Mining CSR roadmap 1 Following the failure to meet the 2024 carbon intensity target (due to an unfavourable product mix), an interim 2025 target was set on the basis of intrinsic performance (excluding volume) to sustain momentum. Outcome: 6.3% improvement in intrinsic efficiency vs. 2024 across all BUs (excl. SLN). 1 CNFEOL (China FerroAlloy Online), “Other mining countries”. In New Caledonia, SLN’s mining production amounted to 3.0 Mwmt in 2025, up 2% year-on-year. SLN’s mining activity remains heavily impacted by the closure of certain mining sites following the riots of H1 2024. Similarly, SLN’s nickel ore exports remained constrained in 2025, at 0.6 Mwmt, down 12% versus the same period last year. Similarly, SLN’s nickel ore exports remained constrained in 2025, at 0.6 Mwmt, down 12% versus the same period last year. In 2025, nickel ore prices (1.8% CIF China), as exported by SLN, averaged $79/wmt, increasing by 8% from 2024. Ferronickel production totalled 36.3 kt-Ni (+10% vs. 2024). Volumes sold stood at 36.2 kt-Ni (+10% vs.2024). Cash cost 2 of ferronickel production averaged $7.9/lb in 2025, down from the same period in 2024 ($8.8/lb). This improvement is owing to higher volumes and lower energy costs, despite an unfavourable currency effect. The consolidated performance indicators used for the financial reporting of the Group's results and economic performance and presented in this document are restated data from the Group's reporting and are monitored by the Executive Committee. Turnover at constant scope and exchange rates Turnover at constant scope and exchange rates corresponds to turnover adjusted for the impact of the changes in scope and the fluctuations in the exchange rate from one financial year to the next. The scope effect is calculated as follows: for the companies acquired during the financial year, by eliminating the turnover for the current period and for the companies acquired during the previous period by integrating, in the previous period, the full-year turnover; for the companies sold, by eliminating the turnover during the period considered and during the previous comparable period. The exchange rate effect is calculated by applying the exchange rates of the previous financial year to the turnover for the year under review. Adjusted turnover is presented to provide a better understanding of the underlying operational performance of the Group's activities. Adjusted turnover corresponds to turnover including Eramet's share of the turnover of significant joint ventures accounted for using the equity method in the Group's financial statements, restated for the off-take of all or part of the business activity. As of 31 December 2025, turnover was adjusted to include the contribution of PT Weda Bay Nickel, a company in which Eramet owns a 38.7% indirect interest. Eramet owns a 43% interest in Strand Minerals Pte Ltd, the holding which owns 90% of PT Weda Bay Nickel and is booked in the Group’s consolidated financial statements under the equity method. An off-take agreement for nickel ferroalloys production (NPI) is in place with Tsingshan, with Eramet holding a 43% interest, and Tsingshan 57%. Adjusted turnover also excludes turnover linked to the sales of nickel ore and others from SLN, as a standalone company, since the entity’s losses were fully financed by the French State in 2024 and 2025, following an agreement signed with Eramet. However, turnover linked to ferronickel trading is still booked in the adjusted turnover (under “Holding”), given the existence of a purchase agreement between SLN and Eramet S.A., and a sales agreement between Eramet S.A. and end customers. A reconciliation with Group turnover is provided in Note 5 to the Group's consolidated financial statements. EBITDA (“ Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation ”) Earnings before financial revenue and other operating expenses and income, income tax, contingencies and loss provision, and amortisation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and tangible and intangible assets. Adjusted EBITDA is presented to provide a better understanding of the underlying operational performance of the Group's activities. Adjusted EBITDA corresponds to EBITDA including Eramet's share of the EBITDA of significant joint ventures accounted for using the equity method in the Group's financial statements. As of 31 December 2025, EBITDA was adjusted to include the proportional EBITDA of PT Weda Bay Nickel, a company in which Eramet owns a 38.7% indirect interest. Eramet owns a 43% interest in Strand Minerals Pte Ltd, the holding which owns 90% of PT Weda Bay Nickel and is booked in the Group’s consolidated financial statements under the equity method. In addition, adjusted EBITDA excludes the EBITDA of SLN as a standalone company, since the entity’s losses were fully financed by the French State in 2024 and 2025, following an agreement signed with Eramet. However, EBITDA linked to ferronickel trading is still booked in the adjusted EBITDA (under “Holding”), given the existence of a purchase agreement between SLN and Eramet S.A., and a sales agreement between Eramet S.A. and end customers. A reconciliation with Group EBITDA is provided in Note 5 to the Group's consolidated financial statements. EBITDA potential improvement for 2026-2027 EBITDA potential improvement corresponds to an increase in the Group's EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA calculated for 2026-2027, with full impact expected in 2028. This potential is calculated on the basis of economic conditions in 2025, using Eramet's realised selling prices and the volumes produced and sold in 2025. Current Operating Income (excluding SLN) Current Operating Income (excluding SLN) is defined as Current Operating Income, restated for SLN’s operating income. A reconciliation with Group Current Operating Income is provided in Note 3 to the Group's consolidated financial statements. Net Income (excluding SLN) / Net Income (excluding SLN), Group share Net income (excluding SLN) is defined as net income, restated for SLN’s net income. Net Income, Group share (excluding SLN) is defined as net income, restated for the Group’s share of SLN’s net income. A reconciliation with Group net income is provided in Note 3 to the Group's consolidated financial statements. Adjusted Free Cash-Flow is presented to provide a better understanding of the underlying cash generation of the Group's activities. Adjusted Free Cash-Flow corresponds to Free Cash-Flow net of (i) Tsingshan’s capital injection in the Centenario project for 2024 and (ii) financing granted by the French State to SLN (in the form of undated fixed rate subordinated bonds (Titres Subordonnés à Durée Indéterminée – “TSDI”) to neutralise the New Caledonian entity’s cash consumption. A reconciliation with Group Free Cash-Flow is provided in Note 5 to the Group's consolidated financial statements. Adjusted leverage is defined as consolidated net debt, restated for the available cash provided by the French State (via “TSDI”) to finance SLN’s future losses, over adjusted EBITDA (as defined above). However, in the future, should other significant joint ventures restated for adjusted EBITDA have external debt, net debt will be adjusted to include Eramet's share in the external debt of the joint ventures (“adjusted net debt”). Adjusted leverage would then be defined as adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA, in compliance with a fair and economic approach to Eramet’s debt. Manganese ore activity corresponds to Comilog's mining activities (excluding the activity of the Moanda Metallurgical Complex, “CMM”, which produces manganese alloys) and Setrag's transport activities. Manganese alloys activity corresponds to the plants that transform manganese ore into manganese alloys. It includes the three Norwegian plants comprising Eramet Norway (“ENO”, i.e. Porsgrunn, Sauda, and Kvinesdal), Eramet Marietta (“EMI”) in the United States, Comilog Dunkerque (“CDK”) in France and the Moanda Metallurgical Complex (“CMM”) in Gabon. Manganese ore FOB cash cost (new definition) The FOB (“Free On Board”) cash cost of manganese ore is defined as all production and overhead costs (R&D including exploration geology, administrative expenses, sales expenses, overland transport expenses), which cover all stages of ore extraction through to shipping to the port of shipment and loading, and which impact the EBITDA in the Company's financial statements, over tonnage sold for a given period. This cash cost does not include sea transport or marketing costs and now also does not include the mining taxes and royalties from which the Gabonese State benefits. Ex-Works cash cost for lithium carbonate The Ex-Works cash cost for lithium carbonate produced by Eramine is defined as all the production and structure costs covering the entire extraction and refining stages required to make the finished or final product upon leaving the plant, and which have an impact on EBITDA in the Company's financial statements, over tonnage sold for a given period. This cash cost does not include land and sea transport costs, mining taxes and royalties from which the Argentine State benefits, or marketing costs. SLN’s cash cost is defined as all production and overhead costs (R&D including exploration geology, administrative expenses, logistical and commercial expenses), net of by-products credits (including exports and nickel ore) and local services, which cover all the stages of industrial development of the finished product until delivery to the end customer and which impact the EBITDA in the Company’s financial statements, over tonnage sold. 1 Definitions presented in the financial glossary in Appendix 10 2 See financial glossary in Appendix 10. Cash cost calculated excluding non-controllable costs: sea transport, marketing costs, mining taxes and royalties 3 Based on a consensus €/USD rate of 1.20 for 2026 4 Excluding the capex of SLN, financed by the French State 5 Revolving Credit Facility 6 TRIFR (Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate) = FR2: Frequency rate of accidents at work of Eramet employees, temporary staff and subcontractors (fatal + Lost Time Injury [LTI] + Non-Lost Time Injury [NLTI]), expressed as the number of accidents per million hours worked 7 IRMA: Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance 8 EGC and Eramet are part of the IRMA assessment system which includes 109 mining companies that have registered 132 mine sites, spanning 36 countries and covering 55 different mined materials. 9 ICMM: International Council on Mining & Metals 10 Audit procedures on the 2025 consolidated financial statements and verification work on sustainability information are in progress.

    "content": "The French banking group’s digital asset unit deploys EUR CoinVertible on a third public blockchain, alongside Ethereum and Solana. French banking group Societe Generale’s digital asset arm, SG-FORGE, has deployed its euro-denominated stablecoin, EUR CoinVertible, on the XRP Ledger, marking the token’s third blockchain launch after Ethereum and Solana. According to Wednesday’s announcement , the rollout is supported by Ripple’s custody infrastructure and could enable integration into Ripple products, including use as trading collateral. SG-FORGE said the move expands institutional access to the euro-backed token across another public network. The launch comes about a month after global banking network SWIFT tested SocGen’s euro-pegged stablecoin in a pilot of exchange and settlement of tokenized bonds in both fiat and digital currencies. SG-FORGE said EUR CoinVertible was the first MiCA-compliant digital asset designed to integrate directly with SWIFT’s interoperability framework. EUR CoinVertible is backed by bank cash deposits or high-quality securities on a 1:1 basis. At the time of writing, there were about 70.51 million of the tokens in circulation . The SWIFT pilot and multi-chain expansion unfold against a broader policy debate in Europe over the future of digital money. On Monday, Joachim Nagel, Germany‘s central bank president, said Europe should advance both a retail euro central bank digital currency (CBDC) and euro-denominated stablecoins, arguing that domestic digital payment tools could strengthen the region’s independence in payment systems. Earlier this month, Nagel cautioned participants at a Euro50 Group meeting that a dominant role for US dollar–denominated stablecoins in Europe could undermine domestic monetary policy and weaken European sovereignty if euro-backed alternatives fail to gain sufficient market share. Related: How Europe’s blockchain sandbox finds innovation in regulation The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCa) regime’s stablecoin provisions went into effect on June 30, 2024, requiring issuers operating in the European Economic Area to obtain an e-money license in at least one EU member state. The rules prompted several exchanges and issuers to delist or restrict tokens that had not secured authorization under the new framework. Coinbase, OKX , Bitstamp, Uphold and Binance were among several platforms that moved to remove or limit support for non-compliant stablecoins in response to the new the provisions. In November 2024, Tether also announced it would wind down its euro-pegged stablecoin EURT , halting minting across all blockchains and giving holders one year to redeem their tokens. Yet while many exchanges and issuers chose to leave the EU, others moved to align with the new rules. In July 2024, Circle became the first global stablecoin issuer to secure authorization under MiCA, a milestone that coincided with a surge in trading activity for its USDC token that month. Meanwhile, in the United States, the passage of the GENIUS Act in July 2025 has accelerated activity in the stablecoin market, with total market capitalization rising from roughly $260 billion on July 19 to about $307.6 billion, according to DefiLlama data . The asset sector remains heavily concentrated in US dollar-pegged tokens issued by Tether ( USDT ) and Circle ( USDC ), which account for more than 80% of the total market cap. The disparity in the market has drawn attention from European central bankers, who argue that strengthening the region’s own stablecoin ecosystem is key to countering growing dollar dominance in digital assets. In December, BNP Paribas said it had joined nine other EU-based banks to launch a euro-backed stablecoin in the second half of 2026 through a newly formed Amsterdam-based entity, Qivalis.

    "content": "Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., February 13, 2026. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid NEW YORK, Feb 18 : U.S. stocks rallied, European stocks notched a record closing high and crude oil prices rebounded on Wednesday as investors parsed the minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's most recent policy meeting and assessed evolving geopolitical developments. All three major U.S. indexes pared gains in afternoon trading but closed in positive territory, while gold rebounded as Ukraine peace talks ended without a clear resolution. A report that Christine Lagarde plans to leave her role as European Central Bank President early dampened the euro and bolstered the dollar. \"(Lagarde) has been a calming voice, and it's been nice to have solid leadership in place,\" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group in Omaha. \"Potential rumors that she might be leaving a tad earlier, it's shaken up currency markets a little bit.\" Subscribe to our Chief Editor’s Week in Review Our chief editor shares analysis and picks of the week's biggest news every Saturday.

Loading On the geopolitical front, as peace negotiations ended, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russia of delaying progress toward reaching a deal. Iran's temporary closure of parts of the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial global oil supply route, also added to supply worries. This \"double-whammy of continued geopolitical uncertainty ... has led to higher oil and higher gold prices,\" Detrick said. Minutes from the Fed's most recent monetary policy meeting revealed officials were in near-unanimous agreement to hold interest rates steady, but remained split over their next move. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 129.47 points, or 0.26 per cent, to 49,662.66, the S&P 500 rose 38.10 points, or 0.56 per cent, to 6,881.32 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 175.25 points, or 0.78 per cent, to 22,753.64. Europe's STOXX 600 closed at a record high, with defense and banking stocks leading the charge, as investors assessed earnings and reports of a leadership transition at the ECB. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 6.28 points, or 0.60 per cent, to 1,048.72. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.19 per cent, while Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 30.30 points, or 1.22 per cent. Emerging market stocks rose 3.64 points, or 0.23 per cent, to 1,559.34.

DOLLAR ADVANCES The dollar strengthened on the heels of upbeat durable goods and housing starts data, while the euro dipped on the report about Lagarde's plans to leave her post early. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, rose 0.61 per cent to 97.73, with the euro down 0.58 per cent at $1.1784. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar strengthened 0.98 per cent to 154.78. In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin fell 2.15 per cent to $66,196.23. Ethereum declined 3.08 per cent to $1,938.20. U.S. Treasury yields rose after solid data reinforced expectations that the Fed will keep rates on hold, and the Treasury Department's auction of 20-year bonds showed lackluster demand. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes rose 3.3 basis points to 4.087 per cent, from 4.054 per cent late on Tuesday. The 30-year bond yield rose 2.8 basis points to 4.7108 per cent from 4.683 per cent late on Tuesday. The 2-year note yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations for the Federal Reserve, rose 3.1 basis points to 3.468 per cent, from 3.437 per cent late on Tuesday. Crude prices surged on worries over supply disruption following the abrupt end to the Russia-Ukraine peace talks and the ongoing conflict between the United States and Iran. U.S. crude jumped 4.59 per cent to settle at $65.19 per barrel, while Brent settled at $70.35 per barrel, up 4.35 per cent on the day. Gold rebounded from a one-week low as rising geopolitical tensions revived demand for the safe-haven metal. Spot gold rose 2.22 per cent to $4,985.46 an ounce. U.S. gold futures rose 2.03 per cent to $4,982.20 an ounce. On the geopolitical front, as peace negotiations ended, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russia of delaying progress toward reaching a deal.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid NEW YORK, Feb 18 : U.S. stocks rallied, European stocks notched a record closing high and crude oil prices rebounded on Wednesday as investors parsed the minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's most recent policy meeting and assessed evolving geopolitical developments. All three major U.S. indexes pared gains in afternoon trading but closed in positive territory, while gold rebounded as Ukraine peace talks ended without a clear resolution. A report that Christine Lagarde plans to leave her role as European Central Bank President early dampened the euro and bolstered the dollar. \"(Lagarde) has been a calming voice, and it's been nice to have solid leadership in place,\" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group in Omaha. \"Potential rumors that she might be leaving a tad earlier, it's shaken up currency markets a little bit.\" Subscribe to our Chief Editor’s Week in Review Our chief editor shares analysis and picks of the week's biggest news every Saturday.

    "content": "MKS ( NASDAQ:MKSI ) said it closed fiscal 2025 with “impressive execution” in a gradually improving demand environment, delivering double-digit sales growth, higher earnings, and expanding free cash flow while continuing to reduce leverage, according to management’s remarks on the company’s fourth-quarter and full-year earnings call. President and CEO John Lee said demand across semiconductor and electronics and packaging markets is strengthening as the company enters 2026, citing “ambitious CapEx plans announced by large chip manufacturers.” CFO Ram Mayampurath added that the company made additional progress on its deleveraging goals, including a $100 million voluntary term-loan prepayment in February and several financing moves intended to reduce interest expense and extend maturities. Get MKS alerts: Sign Up Fourth-quarter results topped guidance midpoints The 3 Favored Machinery Stocks To Buy In August For the fourth quarter, MKS reported revenue of $1.03 billion , up 5% sequentially and 10% year over year. Gross margin was 46.4% , and net earnings were $168 million , or $2.47 per diluted share , which management said was above the midpoint of its guidance range. Mayampurath said gross margin performance came despite “ongoing impact from higher tariffs,” higher palladium prices that are passed through at “zero margins,” and a higher chemistry equipment mix. Operating expenses were $263 million , slightly above the company’s guidance range, primarily due to higher variable compensation tied to stronger-than-expected results. Operating income was approximately $217 million (a 21% operating margin), and adjusted EBITDA was $249 million (a 24.1% margin). Liquidity at quarter-end was about $1.4 billion , consisting of $675 million of cash and cash equivalents and a $675 million undrawn revolving credit facility. Net debt ended the year at $3.6 billion , with a net leverage ratio of 3.7x , based on full-year 2025 adjusted EBITDA of $966 million . End-market performance: semiconductors, electronics and packaging, specialty industrial MKS reported growth across all three end markets in the quarter. Semiconductor: Revenue was $435 million , up 5% sequentially and 9% year over year, driven by strengthening demand in DRAM and logic/foundry applications. Management highlighted subsystems serving etch and deposition, along with continued momentum in plasma and reactive gases. Lee said NAND-related activity was stable sequentially, “as expected,” while orders remained robust in dissolved gases for advanced logic and in back-end applications tied to high-bandwidth memory. Electronics and packaging: Revenue was $303 million , up 5% sequentially and 19% year over year, primarily reflecting increased flexible PCB drilling and chemistry equipment sales. Mayampurath said chemistry sales were up 16% year over year in the quarter excluding foreign exchange and palladium pass-through. Specialty industrial: Revenue was $295 million , up 4% sequentially and 5% year over year, with improvement in research and defense and certain industrial applications, partially offset by softness in automotive. Lee said MKS outperformed estimated wafer fab equipment (WFE) growth for full-year 2025 and argued the company historically outperforms in rising spending environments because many products are “designed in” and because customers tend to build inventory during ramps. Full-year 2025: growth in semiconductors and electronics/packaging, softer specialty industrial For full-year 2025, MKS reported revenue of $3.9 billion , up 10% year over year. Semiconductor revenue was $1.7 billion , up 13% , led by plasma and reactive gases and vacuum products, with the service business described as a steady growth contributor. Electronics and packaging revenue was $1.1 billion , up 20% year over year; total chemistry sales increased 11% excluding FX and palladium pass-through. Specialty industrial revenue was $1.1 billion , down 4% year over year, which the company attributed primarily to industrial softness, including automotive. Gross margin for the year was 46.7% , down 90 basis points year over year, driven by tariff-related costs and mix, including record chemistry equipment sales. Mayampurath said the company mitigated tariff impact “largely” by the fourth quarter on a dollar-for-dollar basis, though tariffs are still expected to pressure gross margin by about 50 basis points . Operating margin was 20.7% , down 60 basis points , while operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved to 26% . Cash flow, debt reduction, and financing actions MKS generated operating cash flow of $645 million in 2025, up $117 million year over year. Free cash flow was $497 million , up 21% , despite increased capital expenditures. In 2025, MKS made $400 million of voluntary term-loan prepayments and followed with another $100 million prepayment in February. Mayampurath said that since February 2024, the company has paid down over $1 billion of debt. Mayampurath also outlined financing transactions completed in recent weeks, including a term-loan repricing (reducing spreads by 25 basis points on the U.S. loan and 50 basis points on the euro loan), an increase in the revolving credit facility size to $1 billion , and issuance of EUR 1 billion of senior unsecured notes. Based on current interest rates, he said the combined actions are expected to reduce annual interest expense on a run-rate basis by approximately $27 million . The company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share (about $15 million ) and said its board authorized a 14% increase in the next dividend, payable in early March. First-quarter outlook and key themes For the first quarter, MKS guided revenue of $1.04 billion ± $40 million , including: Semiconductor: $450 million ± $15 million Electronics and packaging: $305 million ± $15 million Specialty industrial: $285 million ± $10 million The company projected gross margin of 46% ± 100 basis points , with management attributing the sequential step down largely to mix and Lunar New Year-related seasonality, including lower chemistry sales. In response to a question, Mayampurath said mix should improve in the second quarter and further in the third quarter. MKS guided first-quarter operating expenses of $270 million ± $5 million , adjusted EBITDA of $251 million ± $24 million , and earnings per diluted share of $2.00 ± $0.28 . The company expects a tax rate of approximately 21% in the first quarter and 18%-20% for the year, and it expects capital expenditures to average 4%-5% of revenue through 2026. During Q&A, Lee said customer commentary suggested WFE growth could range from the “mid-teens” to about 20% year over year, while emphasizing visibility remains imperfect. He also discussed memory dynamics, pointing to heavy DRAM investment tied to AI demand and suggesting NAND could become a bottleneck, with potential upside from tool upgrades. In electronics and packaging, management said AI is driving higher PCB complexity and layer counts, noting that AI-related chemistry revenue in electronics and packaging grew from about 5% of chemistry revenue in 2024 to about 10% in 2025, with sequential increases through 2025. Lee also said the company plans to ramp its new “supercenter” factory in Malaysia in the second half of the year, describing it primarily as a business continuity initiative built in phases that will add future capacity and resiliency, while noting that supply chain execution—rather than factory space—typically determines constraints during industry ramps.

Management highlighted subsystems serving etch and deposition, along with continued momentum in plasma and reactive gases. Lee said NAND-related activity was stable sequentially, “as expected,” while orders remained robust in dissolved gases for advanced logic and in back-end applications tied to high-bandwidth memory. Electronics and packaging: Revenue was $303 million , up 5% sequentially and 19% year over year, primarily reflecting increased flexible PCB drilling and chemistry equipment sales. Mayampurath said chemistry sales were up 16% year over year in the quarter excluding foreign exchange and palladium pass-through. Specialty industrial: Revenue was $295 million , up 4% sequentially and 5% year over year, with improvement in research and defense and certain industrial applications, partially offset by softness in automotive. Lee said MKS outperformed estimated wafer fab equipment (WFE) growth for full-year 2025 and argued the company historically outperforms in rising spending environments because many products are “designed in” and because customers tend to build inventory during ramps. Full-year 2025: growth in semiconductors and electronics/packaging, softer specialty industrial For full-year 2025, MKS reported revenue of $3.9 billion , up 10% year over year. Semiconductor revenue was $1.7 billion , up 13% , led by plasma and reactive gases and vacuum products, with the service business described as a steady growth contributor. Electronics and packaging revenue was $1.1 billion , up 20% year over year; total chemistry sales increased 11% excluding FX and palladium pass-through. Specialty industrial revenue was $1.1 billion , down 4% year over year, which the company attributed primarily to industrial softness, including automotive. Gross margin for the year was 46.7% , down 90 basis points year over year, driven by tariff-related costs and mix, including record chemistry equipment sales. Mayampurath said the company mitigated tariff impact “largely” by the fourth quarter on a dollar-for-dollar basis, though tariffs are still expected to pressure gross margin by about 50 basis points . Operating margin was 20.7% , down 60 basis points , while operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved to 26% . Cash flow, debt reduction, and financing actions MKS generated operating cash flow of $645 million in 2025, up $117 million year over year. Free cash flow was $497 million , up 21% , despite increased capital expenditures. In 2025, MKS made $400 million of voluntary term-loan prepayments and followed with another $100 million prepayment in February. Mayampurath said that since February 2024, the company has paid down over $1 billion of debt. Mayampurath also outlined financing transactions completed in recent weeks, including a term-loan repricing (reducing spreads by 25 basis points on the U.S. loan and 50 basis points on the euro loan), an increase in the revolving credit facility size to $1 billion , and issuance of EUR 1 billion of senior unsecured notes. Based on current interest rates, he said the combined actions are expected to reduce annual interest expense on a run-rate basis by approximately $27 million . The company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share (about $15 million ) and said its board authorized a 14% increase in the next dividend, payable in early March. First-quarter outlook and key themes For the first quarter, MKS guided revenue of $1.04 billion ± $40 million , including: Semiconductor: $450 million ± $15 million Electronics and packaging: $305 million ± $15 million Specialty industrial: $285 million ± $10 million The company projected gross margin of 46% ± 100 basis points , with management attributing the sequential step down largely to mix and Lunar New Year-related seasonality, including lower chemistry sales. In response to a question, Mayampurath said mix should improve in the second quarter and further in the third quarter. MKS guided first-quarter operating expenses of $270 million ± $5 million , adjusted EBITDA of $251 million ± $24 million , and earnings per diluted share of $2.00 ± $0.28 . The company expects a tax rate of approximately 21% in the first quarter and 18%-20% for the year, and it expects capital expenditures to average 4%-5% of revenue through 2026. During Q&A, Lee said customer commentary suggested WFE growth could range from the “mid-teens” to about 20% year over year, while emphasizing visibility remains imperfect. He also discussed memory dynamics, pointing to heavy DRAM investment tied to AI demand and suggesting NAND could become a bottleneck, with potential upside from tool upgrades. In electronics and packaging, management said AI is driving higher PCB complexity and layer counts, noting that AI-related chemistry revenue in electronics and packaging grew from about 5% of chemistry revenue in 2024 to about 10% in 2025, with sequential increases through 2025. Lee also said the company plans to ramp its new “supercenter” factory in Malaysia in the second half of the year, describing it primarily as a business continuity initiative built in phases that will add future capacity and resiliency, while noting that supply chain execution—rather than factory space—typically determines constraints during industry ramps.

(Photo by Kazuhiro NOGI / AFP) European stock markets rose on Wednesday as traders assessed company earnings and economic data, while oil prices ticked higher following US-Iran talks. Investors looked ahead to minutes from the last Federal Reserve rates meeting for clues on the outlook for US borrowing costs. Tokyo’s stock market closed up one per cent after Washington announced a first tranche of investments by Japan following a pledge totalling $550 billion in a trade deal with US President Donald Trump. The commitments of $36 billion for three infrastructure projects came as Japan comes under pressure to deliver on its pledges made in 2025 in return for lower US trade tariffs. Elsewhere in Asia, the Lunar New Year holiday meant trading floors were shut in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Seoul and Taipei. London’s FTSE 100 shares index led European gains after data showed UK inflation eased in January, paving the way for the Bank of England to cut its benchmark interest rate next month, weighing on the pound. “Lower rates typically translate into weaker sterling which, in turn, flatters the overseas earnings which dominate the (FTSE 100) index,” said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould. Shares in BAE Systems jumped three percent in London after the British military equipment maker reported a rise in annual net profit and a record order backlog. London-listed shares in Swiss resources giant Glencore also rose as it announced a return to profit last year. Paris and Frankfurt stock markets gained in midday deals. The euro dipped against the dollar on a report from the Financial Times that Christine Lagarde would step down before her term as European Central Bank president ends in October 2027. An ECB spokesperson said Wednesday that Lagarde had not decide on leaving before her term expires. Oil prices rose one percent Wednesday as traders assessed negotiations between Washington and large crude producer Iran, as the countries met for talks on the Islamic republic’s nuclear programme. US Energy Secretary Chris Wright warned on Wednesday that the US will deter Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons “one way or the other.” Prices had fallen the previous day after Iran appeared upbeat following the talks with US officials, but Vice President JD Vance said Tehran had not yet acknowledged all of Washington’s red lines.

    "content": "The President of the German central bank has supported the use of euro-pegged stablecoins and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) to protect the bloc’s payments independence. On Monday, Joachim Nagel, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, touted euro-pegged stablecoins and CBDCs as strategic tools for reducing the European Union’s (EU) reliance on the US dollar (USD). In a speech at the New Year’s Reception of the American Chamber of Commerce in Frankfurt, Nagel highlighted that Europe has been affected by geoeconomic fragmentation , which has slowed the bloc’s economic growth and decreased competitiveness over the last couple of years. As a result, the German Central Bank’s chief affirmed that Europe must take “decisive” measures to boost its economic dynamic, focusing on supporting the international role of the euro and making the EU “more independent in terms of payment systems and solutions.” He highlighted the bloc’s efforts with CBDCs, noting that “Currently, the Eurosystem is working hard on the introduction of the digital euro – a retail central bank digital currency, or CBDC. This will be the first pan-European retail digital payment solution, based solely on European infrastructures.” Additionally, Nagel emphasized the role of stablecoins, reaffirming that he sees merit in euro-denominated stablecoins for cross-border payments by both individuals and firms at a lower cost. Last week, he outlined the benefits of the fiat-pegged tokens at a dinner speech at the Euro50 Group meeting. The Bundesbank president noted that stablecoins open the door for programmable transactions and could facilitate cross-border payments by reducing the transaction costs and duration. However, he also discussed the potential European monetary policy challenges in the new geopolitical environment, including central bank independence and the rise of US-denominated stablecoins. According to Nagel, the rise of stablecoins could pose risks for the EU if the digital assets, particularly those denominated in a foreign currency, become widely used as means of payment and store of value in the euro area. He noted that the US, under the Trump administration, has been promoting the development of the crypto industry by working on establishing a clear regulatory framework that protects customers and fosters innovation. Notably, US President Donald Trump signed into law the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, also known as the GENIUS Act, last July, offering a legal framework for issuers to operate within the US. Since then, the sector has seen strong growth, with its market capitalization rising nearly 50% last year from $205 billion at the start of the year to over $300 billion in late 2025. Nonetheless, most of the market is dominated by USD-denominated stablecoins, while the share of euro-pegged tokens accounts for less than 1%. “Thus, if this market composition persists, a hypothetical replacement of a domestic currency with stablecoins would be equivalent to a dollarization of the corresponding economy,” the Bundesbank Chief explained. “In this scenario, the effectiveness of domestic monetary policy could be severely impaired, not to mention that European sovereignty could be weakened.” Nagel asserted that the risk of this scenario materializing is small, but added that authorities are exploring ways to leverage new technological opportunities to reduce its likelihood. He advocated for a wholesale CBDC to allow institutional actors on financial markets to execute programmable transactions in central bank money. In addition, they could support DLT-based payment instruments not directly related to central bank money, such as tokenized deposits and euro-denominated stablecoins. To him, “these measures will allow us to utilise cutting-edge digital technologies to maintain our monetary policy effectiveness in an uncertain geopolitical future. Additionally, they will increase our sovereignty.” For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Rubmar is a crypto enthusiast who likes learning and improving constantly.

    "content": "European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde is reportedly weighing an early exit from the bank just as the EU enters a crucial phase for the digital euro. European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde is considering leaving before her eight-year term ends in October 2027, the Financial Times reported, citing a person â€œfamiliar with her thinking.â€�Â Lagarde, who took office in November 2019, is said to be weighing an early exit ahead of Franceâ€™s April 2027 presidential election so that outgoing President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz can agree on a successor, the FT reported Wednesday. An ECB spokesperson pushed back on the report, telling Cointelegraph: â€œPresident Lagarde is totally focused on her mission and has not taken any decision regarding the end of her term.â€� Her potential departure would come at a sensitive moment for the ECBâ€™s digital agenda.Â Under Lagarde, the ECB has pushed ahead with preparatory work on a digital euro and repeatedly highlighted the need to manage risks from privately issued digital money , including stablecoins, within the new European Union Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) regime . ECB officials have warned that rapidly growing stablecoins could pose financial stability and monetary policy risks in the euro area, even under MiCAâ€™s safeguards, and have argued for a strong market for wellâ€‘regulated euro-denominated stablecoins that can compete with dollar tokens. Related: Digital euro key to payments sovereignty in â€˜weaponisedâ€™ world: ECB exec Lagarde herself has been a vocal critic of Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other crypto assets, calling them â€œhighly speculative,â€� and saying in a 2022 television interview that crypto is â€œworth nothingâ€� and based on no underlying assets, repeating that sentiment even with BTC close to all-time highs in November 2025. A change at the top of the ECB could impact how the institution communicates on, and prioritizes, issues such as the digital euro, stablecoin oversight and crypto-related payment arrangements, even if the overall regulatory direction is set at the EU level. Economists polled by the FT in December identified Spainâ€™s former Central Bank Governor Pablo HernÃ¡ndez de Cos and his Dutch counterpart Klaas Knot as leading contenders to replace Lagarde, with ECB Executive Board Member Isabel Schnabel and Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel also seen as potential candidates. All four have taken cautious stances on crypto. In past speeches , HernÃ¡ndez de Cos has framed crypto assets and stablecoins as a financial stability risk that demands strong regulation and supervision, while Knot has called for a robust global regulatory framework for crypto and stablecoins. Nagel has linked the push for a digital euro to safeguarding European monetary and financial sovereignty, and has called Bitcoin a â€œdigital tulipâ€� that is â€œanything but transparent,â€� warning against treating Bitcoin as a reserve asset.Â Related: Cryptoâ€™s next battle is privacy, but regulators face chicken-egg dilemma Schnabel previously described Bitcoin as a â€œspeculative asset without any recognizable fundamental value.â€� The digital euro project still needs the green light from EU lawmakers, while the ECB has moved into a technical preparation stage and is rolling out collaborations to ensure the digital euro is universally accessible to all. Despite rumors of a possible early departure of Lagarde, ECB Executive Board Member Piero Cipollone confirmed in a speech on Wednesday that EU coâ€‘legislators were expected to adopt the digital euro regulation in the course of 2026. He said that would enable a 12â€‘month pilot in a controlled Eurosystem environment starting in the second half of 2027, with realâ€‘world transactions and a limited group of payment service providers, merchants and Eurosystem staff. The Eurosystem aims to be ready for a potential first issuance of the digital euro during 2029, assuming the legislative process stays on track.

The euro’s ascent against the dollar to levels not seen since 2021 is under the spotlight as it could weigh on prices in Europe just as inflation settles near the 2% goal. While Villeroy stressed that the rally reflects dollar weakness due to US policy uncertainty and has still left the common currency near long-term averages, he said officials are on alert. “The ECB does not have a foreign exchange rate target, but the exchange rate is obviously important for our inflation and growth outlook,” the French official told lawmakers in Paris.

Financial markets have good reason to have less confidence in dollar assets,” he said. Villeroy once again struck a more dovish tone than his ECB colleagues, reiterating that risks of inflation undershooting the target are more significant than those of overshooting. He repeated his call for policymakers to remain “pragmatic” and “agile” when setting interest rates, which have been held at 2% since mid-2025. “Even if our monetary policy is well positioned, it cannot and must not be set in stone,” Villeroy said, also flagging the danger that a surge in cheap Chinese imports weighs on prices. Commenting on France’s own inflation — which has been running well short of the euro-area average for more than a year and stood at just 0.4% in January — he said the current rate isn’t too low and will probably average slightly more than 1% over the whole of 2026, once it overcomes temporary factors like energy costs. Villeroy also reiterated that his decision to step down early to run a charitable foundation for underprivileged children is a “personal decision with deep meaning for me” and has no connection to French elections next year.

Consolidated 2026 cost guidance includes the Company’s current operating mines: the Lamaque Complex, Kisladag, Efemcukuru and Olympias. Cost guidance for Skouries is presented separately. First concentrate production at Skouries has been delayed by approximately one quarter to early Q3 2026, with commercial production expected in Q4 2026. As Skouries advances through ramp-up and reaches commercial production, the Company expects to provide updated consolidated cost guidance. The three-year outlook reflects an exciting inflection to significant cash generation in the second half of 2026, with Skouries transitioning into production. This positions the Company to unlock the full growth potential of the operation in 2027 when Eldorado is expected to achieve a new steady-state production profile, representing approximately 40% growth in gold production compared to 2025. “We are entering 2026 with exceptional momentum,” said George Burns, Chief Executive Officer. “While we have experienced near-term adjustments to the Skouries schedule as we work through commissioning and ramp up, the fundamentals of the project remain excellent and demonstrate a strong cash flow yielding operation for the next few decades. Bringing Skouries online is an important milestone that fundamentally reshapes our cash generation, production profile and cost structure. In addition, across our portfolio, we continue to advance key initiatives that support a step change in growth, operational performance and long-term value creation. At Kisladag, installation of a larger secondary crusher later this year is expected to unlock throughput debottlenecking opportunities, while completion of the geometallurgical study will help inform future mining phases and evaluate the potential benefits of additional HPGR screening. At Olympias, the expansion to 650 ktpa remains on track for completion in the second half of the year, positioning the operation for higher production volumes and improved unit costs as it enters its next phase. At the Lamaque Complex, development of Ormaque is accelerating as we transition from bulk sample completion to full-scale mine development, supporting sustained production growth across the complex. With gold production expected to increase by approximately 40% in 2027, complemented by the addition of meaningful copper production, Eldorado will enter a period of substantial free cash flow generation. Free cash flow growth is driven by higher production volumes and improved margins with the addition of long-life, low-cost production from Skouries, and is supported by a stable portfolio of high performing operations.” Detailed 2026 Production and Cost Guidance Total gold production in 2026 is expected to be second-half weighted, with approximately 65% in H2 2026, driven by the ramp-up of Skouries, the ramp-up at Olympias and the impact of mine waste stripping and grade profile at Kisladag. Total cash costs (3 ) in 2026 for the operations are expected to be between $1,220 and $1,420 per ounce sold and AISC (3 ) for the operations of between $1,670 and $1,870 per ounce sold. The expected increase in 2026 costs is driven by forecasted higher labour costs as a result of inflation (particularly in Turkiye), increased sustaining capital and higher royalty expense, partially offset by higher by-product credits. Exploration and evaluation expenditures are expected to be between $75 and $85 million in 2026, comprising $57 to $65 million of expensed and capitalized sustaining exploration and $18 to $20 million of exploration included in growth capital. General and administrative expenses are expected to be between $40 and $45 million in 2026, and depreciation expense, excluding Skouries, is expected to be between $240 and $260 million. Skouries depreciation expense is expected to be between $15 and $35 million. Lamaque Complex For 2026, production guidance at the Lamaque Complex is expected to be between 185,000 and 200,000 ounces, reflecting a wider range to account for the potential early start of Ormaque, contingent on receiving the operating permit. In 2026, the focus remains on the development of Ormaque and further resource conversion drilling at both Triangle and Ormaque. Total cash costs and all-in sustaining costs per ounce sold are expected to increase primarily due to higher direct operating costs associated with the deepening of the Triangle mine. Additionally, increases are expected as a result of increased labour costs, reagents and consumables to support the Ormaque ramp-up. Costs will also be impacted by a weaker foreign exchange rate and increased royalties reflecting the continued high gold prices. Sustaining capital expenditures for 2026 are expected to range between $70 and $80 million, lower than in 2025 due to the reclassification of ramp development at Triangle to growth capital. Sustaining expenditures include continued development at Triangle, delineation drilling, major equipment replacement, and refurbishment and work on the Sigma tailing storage facility. Growth capital for 2026 is expected to range between $180 and $190 million, and primarily covers development, infrastructure and the fleet for Ormaque; construction of the paste plant; capital development for the Triangle ramp; construction of the North Basin, and the purchase of additional battery electric vehicles (BEVs) for the Triangle mine. Kisladag In 2026, production guidance at Kisladag is expected between 105,000 and 130,000 ounces. The higher metal price environment has opened up significant opportunity for the Kisladag open pit, to allow us to evaluate the opportunity to move from a $1,700 to a $2,100 pit shell, which is expected to open up the western area of the pit and support resource expansion. To facilitate this opportunity and assist in resolving ongoing geotechnical challenges in the open pit, we expect to increase waste stripping in 2026 by 6 to 8 million tonnes. The mine optimization plan is expected to be beneficial in the long-term by improved balancing of ore and waste movement and supporting consistent year-over-year performance. The focus during 2026 is also on advancing key growth initiatives. A larger secondary crusher, ordered in 2025, is scheduled for delivery and installation by Q4 2026 and is expected to facilitate operational debottlenecking and reduce wear on the HPGR. The geometallurgical study to characterize future mining phases and evaluate the potential benefits of additional screening for the HPGR is on track for completion in the first half of 2026. The two large agglomeration drums, ordered in January, are expected to be delivered and installed in 2027. These upgrades are anticipated to enhance permeability, improve leach kinetics and shorten the leach cycle time, unlocking additional value. Total cash costs and all-in sustaining costs per ounce sold are expected to be impacted by inflation not currently being fully offset by the depreciation of the Lira against the US dollar, and increased royalties due to the anticipated continuation of high gold prices. Planned 2026, sustaining capital of between $25 and $30 million primarily includes capitalized overhaul, inter-lifts within the North Heap Leach Pad and geometallurgical drilling. Planned 2026 growth capital of between $130 and $140 million includes the continuation of the capitalized waste stripping campaign, the whole ore agglomeration construction, the phased expansion of the North Heap Leach Pad, and expansion of the carbon in leach (CIC) capacity. Efemcukuru In 2026, production guidance of 70,000 to 80,000 ounces is similar to the previously guided range. Total cash costs and all-in sustaining costs per ounce sold are expected to be negatively impacted by increased labour costs and electricity costs. Higher labour costs are expected as a result of inflation not currently being fully offset by the depreciation of the Lira against the US dollar, in addition to increase in hiring for Kokarpinar development. Higher costs are also expected as a result of increased royalties due to the anticipated continuation of high gold prices. Planned sustaining capital expenditures of between $20 and $25 million for 2026 includes underground development and equipment purchases. The planned growth capital of between $25 and $30 million for 2026 is expected to be primarily focused on development and infrastructure for expansion of the Kokarpinar vein system including portal construction and development of the Bati vein systems. Additionally, it is expected that the mine will transition to self-performance for capital development activities. Olympias In 2026, production guidance of 70,000 to 80,000 ounces at Olympias is an increase in production from 2025, reflecting the commissioning and ramp-up of the 650 ktpa plant in the second half of the year. However, some engineering delays have slightly reduced the 2026 guidance from the previously guided range. Operational focus will be to execute the plan, while closely managing feed blends to balance mineral load and paste dilution which can impact performance of the flotation circuit. The site’s focus will also remain on driving sustainable improvements and long-term success through the continuation of the comprehensive site rejuvenation program. This includes modernizing and optimizing the process plant and surrounding infrastructure, as well as implementing a targeted leadership and skill development program to strengthen capabilities across all levels of the organization Total cash costs and all-in sustaining costs per ounce sold are expected to be positively impacted by increased metal production and improved payability contracts. Continued quarter to quarter variability in AISC and total cash costs are expected due to by-product credits from timing of by-product concentrate shipments. Planned 2026 sustaining capital expenditures of between $25 and $30 million include underground mine development and management of the Kokkinolakas tailings management facility. Planned 2026 growth capital of $40 to $45 million is primarily focused around the mill expansion to support the ramp-up to 650 ktpa, capitalized development and a resource conversion drilling program. Skouries First concentrate production is slightly delayed and is now expected in early Q3 2026 and commercial production in Q4 2026. The delay is estimated to have an approximately $50 million impact on the construction capital. The slight delay to first concentrate and commercial production timing is due to: The project team is actively implementing mitigation measures across all work areas to minimize the impact to the schedule and cost, and to support a safe and orderly start-up. Skouries is a multi-decade project that is projected to deliver positive cashflow and value from the second half of 2026 onwards. Eldorado’s strategy is focused on delivering consistent, low-risk production from long-life assets while driving a step-change in cash flow generation through disciplined growth, underpinned by the commencement of commercial production at Skouries in 2026 and the addition of copper, a critical metal, as a high-margin, value-enhancing contributor to the existing portfolio. Based on the Company’s current assumptions underlying its 2026 cost estimates, approximately 50% of the total Canadian dollar operating expense exposure for 2026 is hedged (providing protection against adverse exchange rate movement below an average floor of USD/CDN 1.30 while allowing participation in exchange rate movement up to an average of USD/CDN 1.41), and approximately 50% of the total Euro exposure for Olympias operating expense for 2026 is hedged (providing protection against adverse exchange rate movements above an average floor of EUR/USD 1.25, while allowing participation in exchange rate movements down to an average of EUR/USD 1.15). Current hedging positions are not factored into 2026 or future guidance .

The Company believes that these measures and ratios, in addition to conventional measures and ratios prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), provide investors an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the Company. The non-IFRS and other financial measures and ratios are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures or ratios of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. These measures and ratios do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS, and therefore may not be comparable to other issuers. With respect to the non-IFRS measures disclosed in this news release, the Company defines them as follows: We define total cash costs following the recommendations of the Gold Institute Production Cost Standard. The production cost standard developed by the Gold Institute remains the generally accepted standard of reporting total cash costs of production by gold mining companies. Total cash costs include direct operating costs (including mining, processing and administration), refining and selling costs (including treatment, refining and transportation charges and other concentrate deductions), and royalty payments, but exclude depreciation and amortization, share based payments expenses and reclamation costs. Revenue from sales of by-products including silver, lead and zinc reduce total cash costs. We define AISC based on the definition set out by the World Gold Council, including the updated guidance note dated November 14, 2018. We define AISC as the sum of total cash costs (as defined above), sustaining capital expenditure relating to current operations (including capitalized stripping and underground mine development), sustaining leases (cash basis), sustaining exploration and evaluation cost related to current operations (including sustaining capitalized evaluation costs), reclamation cost accretion and amortization related to current gold operations and corporate and allocated general and administrative expenses. Corporate and allocated general and administrative expenses include general and administrative expenses, share-based payments and defined benefit pension plan expense. Corporate and allocated general and administrative expenses do not include non-cash depreciation. As this measure seeks to reflect the full cost of gold production from current operations, growth capital and reclamation cost accretion not related to operating gold mines are excluded. Certain other cash expenditures, including tax payments, financing charges (including capitalized interest), except for financing charges related to leasing arrangements, and costs related to business combinations, asset acquisitions and asset disposals are also excluded. Sustaining capital is capital required to maintain current operations at existing levels, including capitalized stripping and underground mine development. Sustaining capital excludes non-cash sustaining lease additions, unless otherwise noted, and does not include capitalized interest, expenditure related to development projects, or other growth or sustaining capital not related to operating gold mines. Growth capital is capital investment for new operations, major growth projects or enhancement capital for significant infrastructure improvements at existing operations. Our December 31, 2025 Management’s Discussion & Analysis (“MD&A”), available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.com and on the Company's website under the 'Investors' section, contains explanations and discussions of historic total cash costs, AISC, sustaining capital and growth capital for the operating mines for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2025. For a discussion of the composition and usefulness of certain of these non-IFRS measures and a reconciliation of these historical measures to production costs, see specifically \"Non-IFRS and Other Financial Measures and Ratios\" in the Company’s Management Discussion & Analysis for the period ended December 31, 2025.

For further information please see the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) filed on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.com under the Company’s profile. \"2025 was a year of strong execution and meaningful progress across our portfolio,” said George Burns, Chief Executive Officer. “We delivered gold production at the higher end of our production guidance with full-year gold production of 488,268 ounces, underpinned by another strong year at Lamaque, and consistent performance from Kisladag and Efemcukuru. Solid operating execution, supported by a favorable gold price environment, translated into strong financial results, including revenue of $1.8 billion, net cash generated from operating activities of $743 million, and free cash flow of $316 million, excluding Skouries. Supported by a strong balance sheet, we have the financial capacity to advance our growth pipeline while retaining flexibility to return capital to shareholders.” At Skouries, construction and commissioning advanced significantly. While near-term timing of first concentrate production at Skouries has shifted to early Q3, the fundamentals of the project remain compelling. Together with the Olympias expansion and progress at Perama Hill, Greece is positioned to deliver a step-change in contribution as we enter our next phase of growth. This is complemented by the Lamaque Complex, where Ormaque and a deep pipeline of high-quality exploration targets continue to reinforce long mine life potential, and by our Türkiye operations, which continue to provide a stable and cash-generating foundation. Our results in 2025 are a direct reflection of the commitment and capability of our employees and contractors across the organization. I want to thank our teams for their focus on safety, operational discipline, and collaboration throughout the year. Looking ahead to 2026, we remain focused on safely delivering Skouries, strengthening our operating foundation, and creating long-term value for our shareholders.\" The Skouries Project, part of the Kassandra Mines Complex, is located within the Halkidiki Peninsula of Northern Greece and is a high-grade copper-gold project. In January 2022, Eldorado published the results of the Skouries Project Feasibility Study with a 20-year mine life and expected average annual production over the life of the mine of 140,000 ounces of gold and 67 million pounds of copper, or approximately 240,000 gold equivalent ounces. ( 3 ) First production of the copper-gold concentrate is expected in early Q3 2026 and commercial production is expected in Q4 2026, with 2026 gold production projected to be between 60,000 and 100,000 ounces and copper production projected to be between 20 and 40 million pounds. Commercial terms for concentrate off-take have been agreed to with counterparties and contract execution expected before the end of Q1. Negotiated concentrate off-take agreements will cover approximately 80% of the copper concentrate for a two to three year term depending on the agreement and we expect to achieve significantly better economic terms than those assumed in the 2022 feasibility study assumptions, as a result of better pricing and treatment charge conditions in the current market. The capital cost estimate for Skouries is $1.16 billion (including recently announced foreign exchange impacts of $43 million and an additional $50 million related to the schedule impacts following a delay in first concentrate production). The project remains fully funded through projected equity contributions and project financing. The Term Facility totalling €680.4 million ($799.5 million) is fully drawn. Project capital totalled $136.6 million in Q4 2025 and $475.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2025. At December 31, 2025, cumulative project capital invested towards phase 2 of construction totalled $980.0 million. Accelerated operational costs of $178 million (including a recently announced $24 million increase related to acceleration of underground development and increased stope widths) include additional pre-commercial underground and open-pit mining and accelerate the purchase of higher capacity mobile mining equipment. Accelerated operational capital was $34.8 million in Q4 2025 and $86.1 million for 2025. As of December 31, 2025, cumulative accelerated operational capital totalled $93.1 million. As at December 31, 2025, overall project progress was 90% when including the first phase of construction and 78% complete for phase 2 of construction. Progress continues on the construction of the crusher building structure with the concrete now complete. The primary crusher is mechanically complete and set in position, with work continuing on finalizing the electrical installations. Conveyors from the primary crusher through the coarse ore stockpile to the process plant have been installed and belt installations commenced in January 2026. The stockpile dome foundation is complete and assembly of the dome structure is progressing. Two of the three reclaim feeders and associated chute work have been installed, with pre-assembly underway on the remaining reclaim feeder. Installation of the prefabricated electrical distribution room was completed at the end of January 2026 with electrical cable installation and terminations in progress. Work in the process plant remains focused on mechanical installations, piping, cable tray and cabling in preparation for first ore. Recent inspections have identified the need to replace the cyclone feed pump variable speed drive capacitors in the process plant main mill discharge cyclone feed, which experienced moisture damage during storage. Temporary replacement equipment has been ordered and is expected to be installed in Q2 2026 with permanent equipment in Q3 2026. High and medium voltage electrical distribution from multiple substations within the process plant network are advancing, and the control building structure is complete with electrical work underway across all areas. The prefabricated electrical distribution room for the compressors has been installed, with cable and terminations progressing. The reagent areas are advancing in line with the commissioning plan through various stages of mechanical, piping and electrical installations. Two of the three tailings thickeners are mechanically complete, with electrical cabling and instrumentation installation underway. The third tailings thickener is not required for start-up and is progressing in line with the plan. Water testing has been completed and piping installations have advanced as the pipe rack installations are completed. Work is advancing on the associated infrastructure, including the pumphouse building piping and electrical work and tank installations in the flocculant building. Electrical installations and cable pulling in the thickeners’ secondary substation building are in progress. Work continues to progress on the filtered tailings plant, which remains on the critical path with electrical installation and commissioning being the final step. The cladding on the filtered tailings building commenced in February 2026. Mechanical work advanced with all six filter presses and associated swivel doors, feeders and conveyors completed. Pipe and cable tray installation are progressing. The compressor building steel structure is complete, and all six compressors and air receivers are mechanically complete. The filter plant tank farm construction has progressed with three tanks complete and the remaining two tanks assembled and water-tested, with internal coating work now underway. The clarifier water tank construction is progressing to plan. The prefabricated electrical distribution room has been installed, with cable tray and electrical installation advancing. Work continues on tailings handling infrastructure including a horizontal and downslope stacking conveyor system. The work on the tailings infrastructure has been impacted by recent rainfall above historic levels which is affecting certain construction accessibility and productivities. The powerline, main and secondary substations are advancing to support start-up in early Q3 2026 . Power line connection delays have resulted from a slower than expected approval of the detailed engineering, which in turn delayed the ramp‑up of the subcontractor. Prior to commissioning final electrical regulatory authority approval requires completion of inspection and energization protocols. Pre-commissioning of the concentrate filter presses has been completed, along with all water testing in the flotation cells and tanks. Pre-commissioning of the pebble crusher is complete, including first fills and completion of construction punch lists. The pebble crusher area has been energized, and hot commissioning of the conveying and process control systems has been completed. Pre-commissioning of the fire, utility, and process water systems has started. Piping and cable installations continued to ramp up during the quarter, with a focus on flotation, grinding, tails filtration, and primary crushing. Commissioning of these areas is expected to commence as sub systems are completed by the construction team. Integrated Extractive Waste Management Facility (the \"IEWMF\") Construction of the Karatzas Lakkos (KL) embankment progressed steadily, with continued advancement of underdrain installation, commencement of the engineered fill raise of the dam, and preparatory works for the next phase of cut-off trench construction. Work is underway to prepare a dedicated area for the initial placement of tailings, however, work productivities have been impacted by recent rainfall above historic levels. Construction of the low-grade ore (LGO) stockpile embankment continued, with the lower section advancing beyond the milestone elevation of 340 RL. Enhancements were made to the construction of the Water Management System, notably the completion of the coffer dam and the implementation of a piling program to ensure the structural integrity of the KT2 diversion channel. The intermediate water treatment plant (IWTP) mechanical installations are well underway, while water treatment plant (WTP) foundation works commenced as planned. The open pit mine successfully continued to ramp up during Q4 2025 with four crews operating ahead of plan in building ore stockpiles for the process plant start-up. At the end of Q4 2025, there were approximately 1.2 million tonnes of open pit and underground ore on stockpiles containing approximately 47.3 thousand ounces of gold and 12.5 million pounds of copper. Grade control drilling covering 95% of the Phase 1 open pit has been completed and confirmed the first three years of production. Underground access development rates continued to accelerate. A total of 1,155 metres of underground development was completed in Q4 2025. During 2025, underground development totalled 3,092 metres, which was approximately 900 metres more development than budgeted during the year. The test stope program delivered high quality results during the quarter. The first of two test stopes were completely mined out and the second test stope mining will be completed in February 2026. Each test stope mined to date is expected to provide approximately 72kt of ore, with dimensions of 60 metres in height and an area of 30 by 15 metres. Ore fragmentation has exceeded expectations, and stope cavity monitoring and extraction has met our expectations. This success has increased our confidence in the planned trial of four larger test stopes in 2026, each designed at approximately 97kt per stope with dimensions of 60 metres in height and an area of 30 by 20 metres per stope. Semi-autonomous ore loading and open stope drilling, with operators on surface (no operator on the equipment), was successfully used during the mining of these two test stopes. This technology enables a single operator to control several pieces of equipment simultaneously, increasing safety, drill accuracy and productivity, reducing idle time between shifts and during blast clearance, and decreasing associated costs. Additional testing of tailings filter cloths is underway for the infill drilling program and from bulk samples from the open pit ore already mined and stockpiled. An initial inventory strategy has been established to support operational resilience and continuity of supply of filter cloths. This strategy includes maintaining six complete cloth sets sourced from three different vendors. Engineering and technical optimization efforts continued for the start-up tailings placement area, and operational readiness activities for tailings stacking. As at December 31, 2025, there were approximately 2,350 personnel working on site, including 415 Skouries employees. 2025 Year in Review: A Pivotal Year for Growth Notable Recognitions and Milestones Across the Business: Consolidated Financial and Operational Highlights Gold sales in 2025 totalled 491,204 ounces, a decrease of 5% from 517,926 ounces in 2024, and 126,923 ounces in Q4 2025, a decrease of 19% from 156,864 ounces in Q4 2024. The lower sales volume in both periods compared to prior year primarily reflected planned lower production across all sites. The average realized gold price (4) was $3,505 per ounce sold in 2025, an increase from $2,405 per ounce sold in 2024, and $4,251 per ounce sold in Q4 2025 compared to $2,625 per ounce sold in Q4 2024, and benefitted from strengthening metal prices throughout the year. Total revenue was $1,818.9 million in 2025, an increase of 38% from revenue of $1,322.6 million in 2024, and $577.2 million in Q4 2025, an increase of 32% from revenue of $435.7 million in Q4 2024. The increase in both periods was due to higher average realized gold prices partially offset by lower volumes sold. Production costs increased to $677.6 million in 2025 from $564.2 million in 2024 and increased to $203.0 million in Q4 2025 from $172.1 million in Q4 2024. Increases in both periods were driven by higher royalties, accounting for approximately 40% of the increase to production costs in the year-over-year comparison. Additionally, there are rising labour costs in Turkiye where cost inflation continues to outpace the devaluation of the local currency, as well as at Lamaque, where additional costs were incurred on labour and contractors due to the deepening of the production centre of the Triangle Mine, resulting in increased haulage distance, equipment and personnel requirements. Production costs include royalty expense, which increased to $124.3 million in 2025 from $79.4 million in 2024, and increased to $44.7 million in Q4 2025 from $26.4 million in Q4 2024 due to higher average gold prices. In Turkiye, royalties are paid on revenue less certain costs associated with ore haulage, mineral processing and related depreciation and are calculated on the basis of a sliding scale according to the average London Metal Exchange gold price during the calendar year. Effective July 24, 2025, amendments to Turkish Mining Law were enacted, which included changes to the base rate table for state royalties on gold metal sales. The price-linked sliding scale of royalty rates has broadened with increasing rate bands, with the highest band at a maximum gold price of $5,101/oz, an expansion from the previous maximum of $2,101/oz. In Greece, royalties are paid on revenue and calculated on a sliding scale tied to international gold and base metal prices and the EUR/USD exchange rate. Total cash costs ( 4 ) averaged $1,176 per ounce sold in 2025, an increase from $940 per ounce sold in 2024. In Q4 2025, total cash costs averaged $1,295 per ounce sold, an increase from $944 per ounce sold in Q4 2024. The increase in both periods was primarily due to higher royalty expense driven by higher gold prices and unit costs, as well as lower gold volumes sold. AISC per ounce sold (4) increased to $1,664 in 2025 from $1,285 in 2024, and to $1,894 in Q4 2025 from $1,226 in Q4 2024. The increase in both periods primarily reflect higher total cash costs per ounce sold as discussed above and higher sustaining capital expenditures. The Company reported net earnings attributable to shareholders from continuing operations of $519.9 million ($2.56 basic earnings per share) in 2025, compared to $300.9 million ($1.48 basic earnings per share) in 2024 and net earnings of $252.3 million ($1.26 basic earnings per share) in Q4 2025, compared to net earnings of $108.2 million ($0.53 basic earnings per share) in Q4 2024. Net earnings attributable to shareholders from continuing operations increased in 2025 and Q4 2025 primarily due to higher revenue from higher average realized gold prices, partially offset by higher production costs and losses on derivative instruments. Adjusted net earnings attributable to shareholders from continuing operations (4) was $354.9 million ($1.75 per share) in 2025, compared to $320.7 million ($1.57 per share) in 2024. Adjustments of non-recurring items in 2025 include removing a $177.7 million recovery for the recognition of deferred tax assets, a $18.7 million gain on foreign exchange due to the translation of deferred tax balances, and a $39.4 million unrealized loss on derivative instruments, among other items. Adjusted net earnings (3) was $126.1 million ($0.63 per share) in Q4 2025, removing a $104.2 million recovery for the recognition of deferred tax assets, a $27.4 million unrealized gain on derivative instruments and a $3.9 million loss on foreign exchange due to the translation of deferred tax balances, among other items. Kisladag produced 168,701 ounces of gold in 2025, a 3% decrease from 174,080 ounces in 2024 due to fewer tonnes placed on the pad and lower grades stacked during 2025. Similarly, gold production of 41,140 ounces in the quarter decreased 27% from 56,483 ounces in Q4 2024, due to lower available stacked ounces. In the year, lower grades of 0.73 grams per tonne in 2025 compared to 0.81 grams per tonne in 2024, resulted in lower recoverable ounces stacked in the quarter. Revenue increased to $595.8 million in 2025 from $423.5 million in 2024 and increased to $185.7 million from $150.3 million in Q4 2024, reflecting higher average realized prices, offsetting lower gold volumes sold in both periods. Production costs increased to $221.1 million in 2025 from $162.7 million in 2024 and to $70.8 million in Q4 2025 from $56.1 million in Q4 2024. The increases in both periods were primarily due to higher royalty expense from higher average realized gold prices and increased royalty rates effective from Q3 2025, as well as rising labour costs and costs of local services mainly driven by inflation exceeding the devaluation of the local currency. As a result, total cash costs per ounce sold increased to $1,264 in 2025 from $918 in 2024 and $1,593 in Q4 2025 from $978 in Q4 2024, which was also impacted by lower ounces sold. Depreciation expense decreased to $90.6 million in 2025 from $93.7 million in 2024 due to lower ounces produced and sold during the year. AISC per ounce sold increased to $1,478 in 2025 from $1,025 in 2024 and increased to $1,933 in Q4 2025 from $1,073 in Q4 2024 due to higher total cash costs per ounce sold and higher sustaining capital expenditures. Sustaining capital expenditures were $28.1 million in 2025, including $12.0 million in Q4 2025, primarily related to equipment rebuilds, and heap leach pad interlifts. Growth capital investment was $104.9 million in 2025, including $34.8 million in Q4 2025 primarily for waste stripping and associated equipment costs to support the mine life extension, continued construction of the second and third phases of the North heap leap pad (\"NHLP\") and additional North adsorption, desorption and recovery (\"ADR\") plant infrastructure, as well as technical studies. Following a comprehensive technical and economic assessment, with a focus on capital discipline, whole ore agglomeration was decoupled from additional screening for the high pressure grinding rolls (\"HPGR\"). This allows for the implementation of the whole ore agglomeration circuit. The investment is expected to be approximately $35 million, and is expected to enhance permeability, improve kinetics, and shorten the leach cycle. Procurement of long-lead items commenced in Q4 2025, with installation of the agglomeration drums targeted for 2027. Following the Q2 2025 decision to expand the secondary crusher circuit to facilitate operational debottlenecking and reduce wear on the HPGR, a new crusher has been ordered, and is expected to be delivered and installed in H2 2026. The geometallurgical study for characterization of future mining phases continues and will evaluate the benefit of additional screening for the HPGR and whole ore agglomeration. This study is expected to be complete in H1 2026. The higher metal price environment has created a significant opportunity for the Kisladag open pit, to allow us to evaluate the opportunity to move from a $1,700 to a $2,100 pit shell, which is expected to open up the western area of the pit and support resource expansion. To facilitate this opportunity and assist in resolving ongoing geotechnical challenges in the open pit, we expect to increase waste stripping in 2026 by 6 to 8 million tonnes. The mine optimization plan is expected to be beneficial in the long-term by improved balancing of ore and waste movement and supporting consistent year-over-year performance. Lamaque produced 187,208 ounces of gold in 2025, a 5% decrease from 196,538 ounces in 2024 as a result of lower average grades and recoveries, partially offset by higher ore throughput. Gold production of 49,307 ounces in the quarter was lower compared to 63,742 ounces in Q4 2024 due to lower throughput rates as a result of a planned shutdown in Q4 and lower grades which influenced lower average recoveries. The gold grade decreased to 6.78 grams per tonne in Q4 2025 from 8.05 grams per tonne in 2025 due to mine sequencing, as well as the high-grade Ormaque bulk sample processed in Q4 2024. Revenue increased to $658.2 million in 2025 from $473.0 million in 2024 and increased to $210.7 million from $165.2 million in Q4 2024. The increase in both periods is due to higher average realized gold prices. Production costs increased to $150.8 million in 2025 from $140.3 million in 2024, and to $43.0 million in the quarter from $38.7 million in Q4 2024, primarily due to higher royalties and additional costs incurred for labour, contractors, and equipment rentals. As a result, total cash costs per ounce sold increased to $790 in 2025 from $711 in 2024, and increased to $841 in Q4 2025, from $615 in Q4 2024. AISC per ounce sold increased to $1,302 in 2025 from $1,134 in 2024, and $1,392 in Q4 2025 from $933 in Q4 2024 primarily reflecting higher total cash costs per ounce sold and higher sustaining capital expenditures during the year. Sustaining capital expenditures were $94.1 million in 2025, including $26.8 million in Q4 2025, primarily related to underground development, delineation drilling, equipment rebuilds and purchases. Growth capital investments of $65.2 million in 2025, including $17.7 million in Q4 2025, primarily related to Ormaque development, construction of the north basin water management structure, procurement of the paste plant, as well as resource conversion drilling. Efemcukuru produced 72,482 payable ounces of gold in 2025, a 10% decrease from 80,143 payable ounces in 2024, reflecting predominately lower grades. Gold production of 14,496 payable ounces in the quarter was 25% lower than 19,451 payable ounces produced in Q4 2024, due to lower grades despite higher tonnes milled. Revenue increased to $275.0 million in 2025 from $199.9 million in 2024 and to $69.1 million in Q4 2025 from $51.0 million in Q4 2024. Increases in both periods were driven by higher average realized gold prices, offsetting lower ounces sold. Production costs increased to $118.1 million in 2025 from $99.9 million in 2024 and increased to $32.6 million in Q4 2025 from $26.9 million in Q4 2024, primarily driven by higher royalty expense as a result of higher gold prices and increased royalty rates in Turkiye effective in Q3 2025. Higher direct operating costs, including labour, were driven by inflation exceeding the devaluation of local currency. Operating cost increases and lower gold production in the year resulted in an increase in total cash costs per ounce sold to $1,510 in 2025, from $1,231 in 2024 and increased to $1,929 in Q4 2025 from $1,376 in Q4 2024. AISC per ounce sold increased to $1,846 in 2025 from $1,411 in 2024 and to $2,536 in Q4 2025 from $1,650 in Q4 2024, primarily reflecting higher total cash costs per ounce sold and higher sustaining capital expenditures as a result of increased development. Sustaining capital expenditure was $22.9 million in 2025, including $8.6 million in Q4 2025, related primarily to underground development as well as equipment rebuilds and purchases. Growth capital investment was $13.4 million in 2025, including $5.0 million in Q4 2025 related to both underground and portal development at Kokarpinar and development costs at Bati. Olympias produced 59,877 ounces of gold in 2025, a 14% decrease from 69,532 ounces in 2024. This primarily reflects lower throughput and recoveries during the year as a result of persistent flotation circuit stability issues due to a paste backfill blend that affected the water chemistry, as well as equipment availability constraints. Gold production of 18,473 ounces in Q4 2025 increased from 15,992 ounces in Q4 2024 as a result of higher gold grades and recoveries despite slightly lower throughput. Lead and silver production decreased in the period compared to Q4 2024, primarily reflecting lower grades. Revenue increased to $289.9 million in 2025 from $226.2 million in 2024 and increased to $111.7 million in Q4 2025 from $69.3 million in Q4 2024, as a result of a higher average realized gold price, offset by lower sales volumes in both periods. Production costs increased to $187.6 million in 2025 from $161.3 million in 2024 and to $56.7 million in Q4 2025 from $50.4 million in Q4 2024. Costs were higher in the quarter and for the year compared to 2024 primarily due to the stronger Euro as well as higher royalties as a result of higher gold prices. These impacts were offset by higher by-product credits from base metal sales, which benefitted from the impact of higher silver prices. This resulted in total cash costs per ounce sold decreasing to $1,324 in Q4 2025 from $1,463 in Q4 2024. Total cash costs per ounce sold increased to $1,722 in 2025 from $1,304 in 2024 due to higher royalties and lower ounces sold. AISC per ounce sold of $1,676 in Q4 2025 was comparable to $1,669 in Q4 2024. AISC per ounce sold increased to $2,145 in 2025 from $1,562 in 2024 primarily due to higher total cash costs, lower volumes sold and higher sustaining capital expenditures. Sustaining capital expenditure increased to $24.1 million in 2025 from $15.4 million in 2024 and to $6.5 million in Q4 2025 from $2.9 million in Q4 2024. Spending in both periods primarily included underground development and mobile mining equipment rebuilds and purchases. Growth capital investments in 2025 relate to underground development and mill expansion infrastructure. The mill expansion to 650 ktpa (from 500 ktpa currently) continued to progress with completion expected in Q3 2026 and ramp-up expected in Q4 2026.

Forward-looking statements and forward-looking information are by their nature based on a number of assumptions, that management considers reasonable. However, such assumptions involve both known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors which, if proven to be inaccurate, may cause actual results, activities, performance or achievements to be materially different from those described in the forward-looking statements or information. These include assumptions concerning: timing, cost, results of our construction and development activities, improvements, and exploration; the future price of gold and other commodities; the global concentrate market; exchange rates; anticipated values, costs, expenses and working capital requirements; our ability to continue accessing our project funding and remain in compliance with all covenants and contractual commitments related thereto; availability of labour resources, including for construction, development and improvements activities; production and metallurgical recoveries; Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources; our ability to effectively use invested capital and unlock potential expansion opportunities across the portfolio; our ability to address the negative impacts of climate change and adverse weather; consistency of agglomeration and our ability to optimize it in the future; the cost of, and extent to which we use, essential consumables (including fuel, explosives, cement, and cyanide); the impact and effectiveness of productivity initiatives; the time and cost of shipping for important or critical items for construction, development and improvements activities or necessary for anticipated overhauls of equipment; expected by-product grades; the use, and impact or effectiveness, of growth capital; the impact of acquisitions, dispositions, suspensions or delays on our business; the sustaining capital required for various projects; and the geopolitical, economic, permitting and legal climate that we operate in.

In addition, except where otherwise stated, Eldorado has assumed a continuation of existing business operations on substantially the same basis as exists at the time of this news release. Even though we believe that the assumptions made and the expectations represented by such statements or information are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statement or information will prove to be accurate. Many assumptions may be difficult to predict and are beyond our control.

The reader is directed to carefully review the detailed risk discussion in our most recent Annual Information Form & Form 40-F filed on SEDAR+ and EDGAR under our Company name, which discussion is incorporated by reference in this news release, for a fuller understanding of the risks and uncertainties that affect our business and operations. With respect to the Skouries Project, these risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause further delays in the completion of the construction and commissioning at the Skouries Project which in turn may cause delays in the commencement of production, and further increase to the costs of the Skouries Project. The specific risks, certainties and other factors include, among others: increase the costs of the Skouries Project. The specific risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among others: our ability, and the ability of our construction contractors to recruit the required number of personnel (both skilled and unskilled) with required skills within the required timelines, and to manage changes to workforce numbers through the construction of the Skouries Project; our ability to recruit personnel having the requisite skills, experience, and ability to work on site; our ability to increase productivity by, among other things,adding or modifying labour shifts; rising labour costs or costs of key inputs such as materials, power and fuel; risks related to third-party contractors, including reduced control over aspects of the Company's operations, and/or the ability of contractors to perform at required levels and according to baseline schedules and any commercial disputes that may arise from a contractor’s failure to meet these requirements; the ability of key suppliers to meet key contractual commitments in terms of schedules, amount of product delivered, cost, or quality; impacts to overhead costs related to the schedule; our ability to construct key infrastructure within the required timelines, including the process plant, filter plant, substation, waste management facilities, embankments, tailings conveyor and control centre; the timely receipt of necessary permits and authorizations; differences between projected and actual degree of pre-strip required in the open pit; variability in metallurgical recoveries and concentrate quality due to factors such as extent and intensity of oxidation or presence of transition minerals; presence of additional structural features impacting hydrological and geotechnical considerations; variability in minerals or presence of substances that may have an impact on filtered tails performance and resulting bulk density of stockpiles or filtered tails; distribution of sulfides that may dilute concentrate and change the characteristics of tailings; unexpected disruptions to operations due to protests, non-routine regulatory inspections, road conditions, or labour unrest; unexpected inclement weather and climate events, including short and long duration rainfall and floods; our ability to meet pre-commercial producing mining or underground development targets; unexpected results from underground stopes; new archaeological discoveries requiring the completion of a regulatory process; changes in support from local communities; and our ability to meet the expectations of communities, governments, and stakeholders related to the Skouries Project. Our project capital and accelerated operational capital costs at Skouries are incurred primarily in Euros but are reported in US dollars and are therefore sensitive to fluctuations in the EUR:USD exchange rate.

    "content": "February 19, 2026 11:36 ET | Source: Coface SA Coface SA Coface closes another strong year with 2025 net income at €222.0m, solvency at 197% and an 84% distribution for a proposed dividend of €1.25 per share Unless otherwise indicated, change comparisons refer to the results as at 31 December 2024 Xavier Durand, CEO of Coface, commented: \"The company continues to show strong performance in a more challenging environment: sluggish global growth driven by AI and emerging markets, continued geopolitical volatility, historically high insolvencies. Additionally, competition on the credit insurance market remains high, weighing on revenues and prices. Our strategy and disciplined execution have enabled us to contain the rise in claims and achieve a net combined ratio of 73.1% for the year, a level now close to our mid-cycle targets. In this harder environment, we remain true to our prudent reserving policy. In 2025, we continued to implement value-creating projects. Our syndicate at Lloyd's provides our clients with a rating that is among the highest in the market. The Cedar Rose and Novertur teams have strengthened Coface's expertise and data quality in growth areas. Our strong balance sheet allows us, in line with our capital management policy, to propose a dividend of €1.25 per share, corresponding to a payout ratio of 84%.” The Board of Directors of COFACE SA approved the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2025 at its meeting of 19 February 2026. The Audit Committee at its meeting on 16 February 2026 also previously reviewed them. Accounts are non-audited, certification is in progress. 1 This estimated solvency ratio is a preliminary calculation made according to Coface’s interpretation of Solvency II Regulations and using the Partial Internal Model. The final calculation may differ from this preliminary calculation. The estimated solvency ratio is not audited. In 2025, Coface recorded a consolidated turnover of €1,847m, up +1.3% at constant FX and perimeter compared to 2024. On a reported basis (at current FX and perimeter), turnover was up +0.1%. Revenue from the insurance activities (including Bonding and Single Risk) was up +0.6% at constant FX and perimeter. In Q4-25, insurance turnover was down by -1.1% compared to Q4-24, which had posted strong growth. Fees and commissions were up +2.3%. Revenues benefited from a retention rate close to record levels (92.9%) in a market that remains competitive. New business reached €129 million, driven by increased demand and benefiting from growth investments. Client activity had a positive impact of +2.6% against a backdrop of considerable political and economic uncertainty, with world trade suffering from the reintroduction of tariffs in the United States. Pricing remained negative at -1.6%, close to the historical average. Revenue from non-insurance activities was up +7.8% compared to 2024. Factoring revenues were down -2.7% due to the fall in interest rates and weak client activity in both Germany and Poland, which was particularly marked in Q4-25. Information services revenue rose by +16.2% (and +18.8% on a reported basis, including Cedar Rose). Turnover from debt collection activities rose by +24.4% from a still modest base, confirming their counter-cyclical nature. In Northern Europe, turnover rose by +0.7% at constant and current FX, driven by a solid sales performance and a slight positive impact from client activity. Factoring revenues were down -0.7%. In Western Europe, turnover was down by -2.8% at constant and current FX (-2.9% at current FX and perimeter). The slowdown in client activity was partially offset by higher information sales (services up +18.6%) and new business. The Financial Institutions segment is still suffering from terminations carried out at the start of the year. In Central and Eastern Europe, turnover was down -3.5% at constant FX (-3.1% at current FX). Credit insurance was negatively impacted by a non-recurring effect recorded in 2024, as well as the transfer of a major contract to the Asia-Pacific region. In the Mediterranean and Africa region, which is driven by Italy and Spain, turnover rose +3.7% at constant FX and +3.0% at current FX on the back of a high retention rate. Economic activity, which had been more dynamic than in the other regions until then, slowed down. In North America, turnover was down -0.2% at constant FX (-5.1% on a reported basis). The region is benefiting from an improvement in new business, but is suffering from a slowdown in client activity and the sharp fall in the dollar since the start of the year. In Latin America, turnover was up +11.7% at constant FX and +4.6% at current FX. The region is benefiting from the persistently high level of local inflation, which is benefiting client activity. In Asia-Pacific, turnover rose +8.5% at constant FX and +4.6% at current FX, driven by client activity and the transfer of a major contract from Central and Eastern Europe. The annual combined ratio net of reinsurance was 73.1% in 2025, up 7.6 ppts year on year. The gross loss ratio stood at 37.5%, a 4.1 ppts from level reached on the previous year. This increase reflects the normalisation of claims, offset by the release of reserves, which remain at a high level. The number of mid-sized claims remains below long-term trends but is increasing. The Group’s provisioning policy remained unchanged. The amount of provisions related to the underwriting year, although discounted, remains in line with the historical average. Strict management of past claims enabled the Group to record 47.0 ppts of recoveries. The net loss ratio was 40.3%, up 5.1 ppts compared to 2024. Coface is pursuing its strict management policy in relation to both costs and investments, in line with its Power the Core strategic plan. Over the full year 2025, costs rose by +6.3% at constant FX and perimeter, and by +5.1% at current FX. The cost ratio before reinsurance was 35.6%, up 1.9 ppt year on year. This rise was mainly due to embedded cost inflation (1.3 ppt) and ongoing investments (1.6 ppt). In contrast, the improved product mix (information services, debt collection and fee and commission income) had a positive effect. Net financial income was €65.8m in 2025. The total includes a negative FX effect of -€21.0m on financial assets, owing to the sharp fall in the dollar against the euro, as well as a negative impact of the application of IAS 29 (hyperinflation) in Turkey of -€11.2m. The portfolio’s current yield (i.e. excluding capital gains, depreciation and FX impact) was €102.3m. The accounting yield 4 , excluding capital gains and fair value effect, was 3.1% for 2025. The yield on new investments was 3.7%. Insurance Finance Expenses (IFE) stood at €9.2m (€42.5m in 2024). They include a significant FX gain (+€23.6m) on technical liabilities, which reflects the expense recorded on assets. Operating profit totalled €332.5m over the year, down 18.7%, mainly as a result of the increase in the combined ratio. The effective tax rate was 24% for the year (25% in Q4-25) vs. 29% in 2024. In overall terms, net income (group share) was €222.0m, down -15.0% compared to 2024. At 31 December 2025, Group shareholders’ equity stood at €2,213.0m, up €19.4m or +0.9% (€2,193.6m at 31 December 2024). These changes are mainly due to the positive net income of €222.0m and the dividend payment of -€209.1m. Other items include changes in unrealised capital gains for €32.4m. The return on average tangible equity (RoATE) was 11.4% at 31 December 2025, down 2.5 ppts mainly due to the change in financial income. The solvency ratio reached 197% 5 , an increase of 1 ppt compared to 2024. It remains well above the upper end of the target range (155%-175%). Coface will propose €1.25 dividend per share at the Shareholders’ meeting, corresponding to a payout ratio of 84% 6 , in line with its capital management policy. After months of negotiations, the United States introduced an historically high number of trade barriers, bringing the effective rate of tariffs to an average of nearly 15%. Their recessionary effect was coupled with an increasingly hardline migration policy, which helped to maintain a certain balance in the labour market while creating political tensions domestically. Economic growth in the United States seems to be increasingly dependent on the single segment of investments related to the development of artificial intelligence: storage centres, computers and associated energy production. While the Fed seems satisfied with current interest rate levels, the forthcoming appointment of a new Chair has resulted in uncertainty over future interest rate policy and its consequences for the economic trajectory. The global economy continued to benefit from the fall in oil prices due to the rise in OPEC production. However, the rapid intervention by the USA in Venezuela and the renewed pressure on Iran marked the start of a new, more uncertain phase in international relations. While real growth remains weak and energy prices are falling, global trade in value terms remains sluggish, weighing on the growth prospects for the trade credit insurance market. Against this backdrop, Coface's disciplined underwriting policy has enabled it to again report very good results. 2025 was marked by two acquisitions (Cedar Rose and Novertur) but thanks to its strong balance sheet and significant levels of cash flow, Coface is paying a very attractive shareholders’ return with dividend of €1.25 per share at the General Meeting. This is bringing the cumulative dividend over 5 years to almost €7 per share. The current turbulence on the markets has created an uncertain environment that supports demand for credit risk management solutions in the areas of insurance, information and debt collection. Against this backdrop, Coface continues to implement its strategy in a determined manner and to invest in technology, data and distribution in the most promising segments.

    "content": "Having removed Venezuela’s socialist President Nicolas Maduro in January, the Trump administration is now endeavoring to rebuild Venezuela after decades of corruption, neglect, and theft. Under Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, Venezuela declined from what was once South America’s richest country and among the 20 wealthiest in the world to “a failed petrostate .” Between 2014 and 2021, Venezuela’s gross domestic product shrank by more than 70%. Today, the country’s infrastructure is in tatters, its judicial system is riddled with corruption and cronyism, and, given Venezuela’s history of expropriating private assets, many foreign investors say the country is “ uninvestable .” In addition, much of the country’s wealth and savings evaporated as the nation’s currency, the bolivar, endured two episodes of hyperinflation, peaking at 234% per month in 2018, and again exceeding 150% per month in 2020. How does a country begin to recover from this? Having spent decades advising governments on how to fix their broken economies, Johns Hopkins economist Steve Hanke, known as the “money doctor,” says he has seen worse. “China was in a lot worse shape than Venezuela in 1979, so all these things are possible,” Hanke told The Daily Signal. But the first critical step is stabilizing a currency that has been in free fall. “If they can’t get the inflation genie back in the bottle,” he said, “nothing much really is going to happen.” When Hanke was adviser to Bulgaria in 1997, that country was likewise suffering from economic ills, including runaway inflation and a banking crisis. The solution he proposed was a currency board, in which a country’s domestic currency is 100% backed by a foreign reserve currency, like the U.S. dollar or euro, at a fixed exchange rate. “The inflation rate was 242% per month, and we put in the currency board in July and smashed inflation immediately, down to below 10% on an annual basis,” he said. Within a year, Bulgaria’s foreign exchange reserves had tripled, short-term interest rates were down to 2%, the banking system returned to solvency, and the economy was growing again. Last month, Bulgaria qualified to join the euro area . Following this model, currency stability was similarly achieved in countries like Estonia, Lithuania, and Bosnia. Hanke had also recommended a currency board to Venezuela’s then-President Rafael Caldera in the 1990s, but those were different times. “The rule of law has deteriorated so much that I would never recommend a currency board right now,” Hanke said. Instead, he said, Venezuela should do away with the bolivar entirely and adopt U.S. dollars as the national currency. In a process called dollarization, “you essentially get rid of the central bank, get rid of the local currency and replace it with what would have been the anchor currency under a currency board,” he said. Dollarization has been implemented effectively in Panama, El Salvador, and Ecuador. Venezuela is informally dollarized , with estimates that more than half the transactions there are conducted in dollars already. Once macroeconomic stability is achieved, the government can then begin to “chip away at all these other things that have to be done,” he said. “If you look at the big reforms, like in New Zealand or Great Britain with [Prime Minister Margaret] Thatcher, or the Chicago boys in Chile, these things didn’t happen overnight,” Hanke said. “You have to build confidence and momentum, and let the momentum carry you along opportunistically, and pick these things off one at a time.” Much of the focus since January has been on Venezuela’s massive oil reserves, though its wells are currently in disrepair after decades of government mismanagement and theft. “Chavismo has rendered the world’s largest crude oil reserves effectively worthless,” Hanke said, and to date, Western oil companies have been reluctant to reinvest. In January, Venezuela’s parliament passed a new law intended to open its oil industry to private development, but it will probably have to do more to attract investment back into the country. Venezuela must establish a credible legal system to guarantee property rights, such as the laws that Chile put in place for mining concessions in the 1980s, Hanke said. “Chile’s mining law established sound property rights and clear rules of the game,” Hanke said. “Among other things, the law mandates that if an expropriation by the state occurs, the state must pay the owner the full present value of the future cash flows from the property that has been expropriated,” as well as stipulating that foreign investors are treated the same as Venezuelans. Beyond oil, other industries that have great potential include agriculture and mining, which were also subject to nationalization under Chavez and Maduro. Venezuela has a wealth of unused agricultural land and extensive freshwater resources, but “land prices are extremely depressed under the weight of severe legal and political risk,” Hanke said. “Property rights insecurity, input-market disruption, price and exchange controls, and infrastructure decay have combined to push the sector far below its production possibility frontier.” In addition, “there are considerable reserves of gold, iron ore, bauxite, coal, nickel, and some critical materials, like coltan,” Hanke said. “But, like agriculture, mining is plagued by infrastructure problems.” For America’s part, Hanke called for a complete end to the U.S. embargo. “The first immediate action the U.S. should take in Venezuela is to remove all sanctions, and this could literally be done with the stroke of a pen,” he said."

    "content": "Yannis Stournaras tells POLITICO why eurobonds have now become essential. ATHENS — Yannis Stournaras was campaigning for joint EU debt long before it was trendy. But now the Bank of Greece governor is setting his sights on his toughest audience yet: The German government. In an interview with POLITICO, Stournaras said the arguments are on his side. Relentless crises have left heavy debt burdens on the shoulders of EU governments, limiting the power of the public purse to tackle challenges posed by U.S. trade tariffs, Russia's war in Ukraine and Chinese threats to limit exports of critical raw materials Without common bonds to fund defense, the green transition and strategic investments, the EU's economy will fail to compete on the global stage, he believes. What's more, Stournaras has the German and Dutch central banks on his side after the European Central Bank ended a 15-year internal feud over the need for “a common European, highly liquid, euro-wide benchmark safe asset” — in short, eurobonds. The ECB’s Governing Council of central bankers issued their rallying call to EU leaders during an informal summit earlier this month. It's time governments got on board too, according to Stournaras. “The present international environment has been a wake-up call to European policymakers,” the 69-year-old said. “The resulting political momentum is certainly promising.” His optimism contrasts with continued opposition from German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who rejected the idea outright at an EU summit last week. “I do worry,” Stournaras said about continued pushback from Berlin. “But I’d like to convince them.” Stournaras, who served as Greek finance minister from 2012 to 2014 before moving to the central bank, certainly has a lot of practice in such advocacy. He had long found himself isolated, along with his Italian colleague, on the Governing Council. During the height of the sovereign debt crisis, their position was often ascribed to national interest, as their countries stood to benefit disproportionately from shared borrowing. “Some years ago, we were one, maximum two Governing Council members arguing in favor of eurobonds,” Stournaras recalled. “The rest of us thought, ‘You are coming from the European South, so it’s understandable.’ But now we have all realized how important it is.” Now, even Germany’s Bundesbank, the de facto leader of the skeptics, has turned. As Stournaras sees it, the fact that southern EU countries that were teetering on the brink of bankruptcy a decade ago are now performing well has helped to shift views. Certainly, the subsidy from Berlin to other capitals that is implicit in joint borrowing has shrunk sharply. The infamous “spreads,” which represent how much more Greece and Italy had to pay than Germany to borrow for 10 years, now stand at less than 1 percentage point. The most powerful argument, however, is a clear message from investors that all of Europe will benefit from joint debt, Stournaras argued. “If you talk to any important wealth manager, either in Europe or in the United States, and ask her why most of the current account surplus we have in Europe is flowing abroad, she will tell you that the lack of sufficient safe assets is the critical issue,” he said. “It is even more important than the rate of return.” Joint issuance should serve “well-defined common European purposes,” Stournaras said. “You have three common needs in Europe that can be funded commonly. Defense, green transition, innovation.” Advocates of joint borrowing argue that a more liquid market for safe euro assets will enhance the region’s relative attractiveness for global capital, at a time when the reliability and desirability of dollar assets are coming under increasing scrutiny. Competing with the dollar for global reserve currency status could ultimately — if only gradually — lower the cost of borrowing and investing for governments, companies and households. The Greek declined to say how much new debt, exactly, would be needed to make a real change to financial conditions in Europe, but said there needs to be meaningful amounts of both short- and long-term issuance. Short-term debt serves largely as a place for investors to ‘park’ money temporarily, while long-term debt typically provides a benchmark price for private-sector projects with long pay-off periods, such as infrastructure. Stournaras stressed that eurobonds “cannot become a substitute for sound national fiscal frameworks.” But he argued that new rules or oversight bodies are also unnecessary. The central banker pointed to past experience — specifically the €800 billion post-pandemic recovery fund — as a successful precedent. “Crucially, [recovery fund] financing was linked to clearly-defined European objectives, time-bound commitments and reform conditionality. This architecture helped alleviate moral hazard, while enhancing credibility in markets,” he said. Critics would argue that moral hazard wasn’t completely removed. Under Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Italy, in particular, helped to finance its budget-busting \"Superbonus\" tax credit with NGEU money, forcing Conte’s successor Giorgia Meloni into drastic corrective action in recent years. The debate over Europe’s financial architecture is proving more exciting this year than the near-term monetary policy outlook. Stournaras said that “the euro area economy remains in a good place” with inflation projected to converge to the ECB’s 2 percent target over the medium term and the economic activity proving resilient. He acknowledged that the risks to growth and inflation appeared broadly two-sided. But on balance, he said, there’s a “slightly higher” chance of the ECB’s next move being down rather than up. In any case, he said, there is no reason to hold one’s breath: “Unless the sky falls on our head, don’t expect sexy news from Frankfurt this year.” While the European Central Bank moved to quell speculation the president will quit, an early exit would provide the French leader with an opportunity. Joachim Nagel’s shift on eurobonds reflects today’s “different reality,” he told POLITICO. “The outlook is still uncertain, owing particularly to ongoing global trade policy uncertainty and geopolitical tensions,” the central bank said. Governments and central bankers can’t suppress their panic reflex at the signs of dollar weakness."

    "content": "Lagarde exit talk is loud, but one hidden signal decides the digital euro’s real timetable. Also known as \"Akiba,\" Liam Wright is a reporter, podcast producer, and Editor-in-Chief at CryptoSlate. He believes that decentralized technology has the potential to make widespread positive change. European Central Bank President, Christine Lagarde, runs an institution that trades in certainty, and she does it in a moment that rewards ambiguity. Earlier this week, the story around her took on a familiar European shape: official silence wrapped around very specific timing. The FT reported Lagarde is expected to step down before her term ends in October 2027, with the timetable linked to France’s April 2027 presidential election and the succession politics that follow. Markets watch those puzzles closely because the next name at the microphone can change the texture of every decision. The ECB, via a spokesperson , kept the public line simple: Lagarde has taken no decision on finishing her term and remains committed. That set of headlines would usually sit in the “personnel” bucket. It lands differently this week because it arrives alongside a second story with dates, budgets, and a clear sense of momentum: the digital euro. Central banks speak in long arcs, and this is one of those arcs turning into a schedule. The ECB says it has moved into the next phase of the project, with workstreams that include system setup and piloting, in its phase update. In the pilot materials, the ECB points to a call for expressions of interest for payment service providers in Q1 2026. It flags March 2026 as the publication month, with the call expected to run around six weeks, according to the pilot deck. When an institution like the ECB puts months on a slide, the ecosystem reacts in human ways. Banks schedule meetings, payments companies assign teams, and compliance departments start drafting. Politicians ask staff for language that can survive a debate on privacy and control. Lagarde’s visibility has mattered here because she has acted as the public translator for a project that touches daily life. A leadership calendar is colliding with a payments calendar, and the next few weeks could turn the digital euro from a concept people argue about into a process companies have to respond to. Let's start with the leadership clock. Lagarde’s term ends in October 2027, and FT reporting ties early-exit expectations to France’s April 2027 election window. That timing matters in Europe because institutions share an atmosphere with national politics, and careers and coalitions often move on the same track. That tells you what markets want from this moment: a smooth handover, a clear narrative, and no surprises. Then there is the project clock, and it is easier to pin down. The pilot materials sketch an on-ramp that begins with provider selection in Q1 2026, with a call published in March 2026 that is expected to run about six weeks. The same materials set expectations for a pilot starting in the second half of 2027 and running for 12 months. They describe real-world transactions inside a controlled environment. This is where Lagarde’s personal timeline becomes more than gossip. The ECB also ties its bigger promise to a political hinge. It works from an assumption that legislation is adopted in 2026, and it aims for readiness for potential issuance in 2029 on that basis. Leadership matters here in the way it always matters in big public projects: through tone, persuasion, and the ability to keep multiple capitals aligned with one calendar. The word “pilot” can sound like a warm-up lap. The ECB’s version looks more like an infrastructure test with guardrails. The pilot materials point to a start in H2 2027, running 12 months, with real-world transactions in a controlled environment. They also offer a scale clue as about 5,000–10,000 Eurosystem staff are reportedly involved, alongside a small merchant set of about 15–25. That scale hints at what the ECB wants from this phase. It wants proof the plumbing works and a pressure test for how intermediaries fit into the system. It also wants to shape public expectations without triggering a broad shift in behavior before the legal framework is settled. That helps explain why leadership turnover reads as a question of continuity and messaging more than a question of whether the project survives. The ECB describes a governance structure designed to keep this moving through institutions. Digital euro work is steered by a Eurosystem High-Level Task Force that reports to the Governing Council, as outlined on its governance page. That structure keeps the machine running, and it leaves the biggest variable where it belongs: politics and persuasion. A successor can keep the plan on track and still change the public framing, especially around privacy, control, and how hard the ECB pushes lawmakers to stay aligned with the 2026 legislative assumption. The digital euro debate can float above daily life, framed as strategy and sovereignty. Numbers bring it back to households. The ECB has put a price tag on the build. It estimates total development costs around €1.3 billion, and annual operating costs around €320 million from 2029, according to its cost estimates. That is public money aimed at creating a new layer of payments infrastructure. It also comes with a promise that the end result will serve the public, not just the industry. Set that next to the baseline the ECB is trying to protect: public money people can hold. Euro banknotes in net circulation sit around €1.6 trillion as of January 2026, based on the ECB’s banknotes data. Market-moving headlines and context delivered every morning in one tight read. Cash still exists at enormous scale, even as the habit of using it shifts across countries and generations. Zoom out again and you reach the wider pool of liquid money that frames every conversation about deposits and stability. Euro area M2 is around €16.07 trillion as of December 2025, based on the ECB’s M2 data. This is the backdrop for concerns about bank funding, arguments over holding limits, and political lines about protecting savers. These figures also help explain why stablecoins hover around the edges of this story. A central bank moving toward a public digital instrument shifts how Europe defines safe digital money. That definition feeds into regulation, partnerships, and how payment rails compete for real users. The immediate market reality is likely to stay calm, even if the longer-term story still matters. Monetary policy in the euro area is set by the Governing Council, and the president shapes how those decisions are communicated and understood. That communication premium shows up most during transitions. It shows up first in the language markets trade: confidence, caution, and the implied reaction function. The macro backdrop also matters for tone. On Feb. 5, 2026, the ECB held the deposit facility rate at 2.00% and reiterated a data-dependent approach in its decision statement. Inflation is also easing. Annual inflation was at 1.7% in January 2026, down from 2.0% in December 2025. That context shapes how a leadership story lands. In a calmer rate regime, communication carries more weight, and the personality at the top becomes a signal people look for even when votes are spread across many hands. The cleanest forward-looking map sits with the digital euro’s legal gate, because the ECB ties readiness to legislation. If lawmakers adopt the regulation in 2026, the ECB’s working plan targets readiness in 2029. If the law slips into 2027, that logic pushes readiness toward 2030. That also opens more room for private rails, including regulated euro stablecoins, to position themselves as an everyday bridge. If the law drifts further, readiness drifts with it. The story then shifts toward Europe’s slower pace while global crypto liquidity keeps leaning on dollar-based stablecoin infrastructure. The next tangible milestone sits in March 2026. The ECB expects to publish its call for expressions of interest then, with a run of around six weeks. That window forces companies to decide whether they want a seat at the table. It also forces policymakers to treat the digital euro as an active file with deadlines attached. Lagarde’s status remains an open question in public, as captured by the spokesperson line in the WSJ. The project calendar looks more concrete, and it keeps moving. People will experience any digital euro through banks, apps, merchants, and the routines that make payments feel invisible. The decisions sit with lawmakers and the ECB. The moment feels like a hinge because two clocks are advancing together, one personal, one institutional, both pointing toward choices that shape how Europe pays and how crypto fits into that future. Switch categories to dive deeper or gain broader context. Privacy, usability, and decentralization keep colliding, and spam plus key management turns switching into a losing bet. From the Waltio breach to suspected insider access, identity data is becoming the most valuable precursor to violence. Lobbying is turning into a moat as lawmakers draft crypto rules and enforcement targets the easiest control points. Brokers are reporting 2025 proceeds without cost basis, so a “done in one click” import can quietly inflate gains. Asserting confidence in long-term growth, IP Strategy initiates strategic stock buyback amid undervaluation concerns. The ICP Zero-Fee Gala attracted 350,000 visitors with its diverse reward structure and zero-trading fee model, highlighting MEXC's commitment to user empowerment.

Can Europe Survive? The Story of a Continent in a Fractured World , David Marsh, Yale University Press, 528 pp., $35, November 2025 But for many Europeans themselves, there is a cloud of pessimism that hangs over all this. They look jealously toward the United States and its higher rates of economic growth and world-beating technology companies, and gripe about the EU’s glacial pace of reform, lack of will, and divergent interests among member states. David Marsh writes Can Europe Survive? in this skeptical tradition. The former Financial Times European editor interviewed dozens of former officials to craft a well-written narrative history of key moments in Europe’s recent past—including the evolution of German-Russian relations, Brexit, and the European debt crisis. He paints an overall picture of a Europe buffeted by a cyclone of internal and external pressures. The book contains some helpful reporting—particularly on the European debt crisis—but ends up unsatisfactorily dodging the exam question of “whither Europe?” It also offers a hurried treatment of the most pressing challenges facing Europe today. The focus on Germany’s fitful relationship with the Putin, Mario Draghi’s “whatever it takes” heroics to save the euro, and Brussels’ wayward relationship with the U.K. are historically interesting but feel less urgent as Europe stares down a volatile and often openly hostile Trump administration and a mercantilist China that is hollowing out European industry (a topic which Marsh treats only passingly). Can Europe survive? Indeed it can—and will. Marsh’s existential (and negatively framed) title is somewhat of a distraction. The real question is whether Europe will move at the speed of relevancy to boost its own geoeconomic and geopolitical vitality, enabling it to act as a forceful player on the world stage rather than a victim of events. On this, the jury is still out, and there is ample evidence in either direction. A Spanish military instructor (right) trains a group of Ukrainian soldiers at the Spanish Army base in Toledo, Spain, on Dec. 2, 2022, as part of EU military assistance to Ukraine amid the country’s ongoing conflict with Russia. THOMAS COEX/AFP/Getty Images If you squint, the last five years look like a march of European progress toward more cohesion, stronger self-defense, and geopolitical assertion. One could easily tell a story of Europe rising to the occasion during multiple generational crises since 2020, repeatedly ending up in a better place of more integration and unity than it began. The COVID pandemic catalyzed Europe to jointly borrow 800 billion euros ($945 billion) as part of its NextGenerationEU program, a show of fiscal force that crossed the previously bright line of pooling debt. The resolution of Brexit was certainly volatile, but left a more integrationist core at the heart of the EU. And the invasion of Ukraine saw Europe rally to Kyiv’s aid in a way that surprised outside observers: Brussels imposed sweeping sanctions against Moscow and froze 210 billion euros in Russian central bank assets, survived a previously unthinkable nearly full shutoff in Russian gas (which had accounted for 40 percent of imports), and has furnished 201 billion euros in military and financial aid to Kyiv, compared to 115 billion euros from the United States. The second Trump administration has provided yet another near-existential jolt to the continent, threatening sky-high tariffs and even the annexation of Greenland—and again Europe has taken dramatic action in response. Germany announced an infrastructure and defense plan that could be worth up to 1 trillion euros, smashing its debt brake (yet another sacred cow) to boost growth and its own military capabilities. Europe launched a successful 150 billion euros in jointly funded loans to member states for defense procurement as part of its Readiness 2030 program, and earlier this month approved a loan worth 90 billion euros to keep Kyiv in the fight through 2026 and 2027. The United States is conducting diplomacy by way of the \"Law and Order\" television show. And that’s not to mention the 2024 Draghi report on enhancing Europe’s economic and geopolitical competitiveness and the flurry of associated efforts to break down internal barriers and protect its own economic interests—from the EU’s Competitiveness Compass to economic security initiatives and progress on the savings and investment union plan to unify Europe’s notoriously fragmented capital markets. Today, all of Europe’s most important leaders—whether Ursula von der Leyen in Brussels, Emmanuel Macron in Paris, or Friedrich Merz in Berlin—are committed to progress on further integration and a more sovereign and capable Europe. Even many of the stories Marsh tells leave the reader with a grudging faith in Jean Monnet’s famous dictum that “Europe will be forged in crisis.” The extraordinary measures that Draghi took to save the euro during the debt crisis are case in point: In 2011, the euro was on the brink of collapse; today, the euro has gained more than 10 percent on the dollar since Trump’s inauguration as the world views the single currency as an increasingly reliable safe haven and the European Central Bank a model of central bank independence and competency. What’s not to like? Open your eyes a bit more and the frustrations and challenges emerge. Take Russia. Europe fumbled the ball in December 2025 by refusing to seize Russia’s frozen assets outright, a key test of political will on whether Europe would prioritize supporting Ukraine over inflated concerns about the impact of confiscation on Europe’s attractiveness for international capital. If Europe can’t muster the steel to use Moscow’s own money to defend Kyiv, what does that bode for when Europe’s budgets get tight? European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen talks about the EU Competitiveness Compass in Brussels on Jan. 29, 2025. MARTIN BERTRAND/Hans Lucas/AFP/Getty Images On generating European defense capabilities, the money, so to speak, is not the main issue. Since 2022, Europe’s defense spending has increased an eye-watering 50 percent, and the new NATO target of 3.5 percent of GDP going toward defense budgets will, in theory, increase European spending by hundreds of billions a year more by 2035 if the political will for higher spending can be sustained. The problem remains the way in which Europe is embarking on its own rearmament. Spending is still happening in a largely distributed fashion across competing national champions, with only marginal progress in the way of shared platforms and planning that will generate scale. Moreover, since 2022 an estimated 36 percent of European defense contracts have gone to U.S. weapons. If Europe is serious about defense readiness, it needs to spend at the EU level on shared systems and platforms within Europe, potentially using joint EU funding rather than relying on national budgets. And doing so will have the ancillary benefits of enhancing economic and productivity growth. An increase in annual European defense spending from 2 percent to 3.5 percent of GDP could lift GDP by 0.9 percent to 1.5 percent a year, according to the Kiel Institute , and every 1 percent GDP increase in defense spending can increase long-term productivity by 0.25 percent. But that’s only if Europe spends domestically and cohesively, rather than across a fragmented landscape of overlapping national programs. But perhaps most important—and urgent—is boosting Europe’s own economic competitiveness. Let’s face it: Europe’s economic engine is puttering, not purring. The United States increased real GDP by nearly 25 percent between 2015 and 2024 compared to Europe’s 15 percent, and Europe is projected to grow roughly 1 percent lower than the United States in 2026 and 0.6 percent lower in 2027. This disappointing picture is largely due to lingering internal barriers within the single market—which the International Monetary Fund estimates are equivalent to a 44 percent tariff on intra-EU trade in goods and 110 percent on services—and the lack of integrated and vibrant capital markets that can fund start-ups and scale innovation. Unlocking this opportunity will be hard. Mario Draghi meticulously laid out the roadmap in his 2024 competitiveness report, but implementing his recommendations—on everything from creating more pan-European company champions to coordinated industrial policy to harmonizing bankruptcy laws—have been excruciatingly slow. Only 11 percent were completed as of September 2025, one year after the release of his report. Yet this competitiveness agenda is perhaps the most important item on Europe’s plate. Bending the productivity and growth curve upward will give Europe sufficient weight to pursue its own priorities on the global stage, allowing it to push back against China—or even a bullying United States—by arming the continent with more economic leverage. It will also help to keep the populists at bay through the salve of rising economic well-being. Geoeconomic vulnerability has also led to a halting and disorganized approach to China, which is perhaps Europe’s biggest long-term external economic challenge. Over the past decade, China has flipped the script as it’s steadily climbed up the sophistication curve in industry after industry, with exports growing and imports flatlining: China went from a 100-billion-euro net surplus with Europe in 2014 to around 300 billion euros in 2024, peaking at 400 billion euros in 2022. As China has eaten away market share in core European industries like autos, machinery, and chemicals, the EU has done a woeful job putting up sufficient tariffs and other protections to balance out China’s own subsidization of these sectors—in part due to the ability of Beijing to successfully play member states off of one another with the promise of investment and threats of duties. Unless Europe develops a cohesive strategy to stand up to China to protect its own markets, China’s trade surplus will only grow and the lifeblood of Europe’s economy will continue to drain. Former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi addresses the audience during a conference titled “One Year After the Draghi Report” at the EU Charlemagne building in Brussels on Sept. 16, 2025. Omar Havana/Getty Images If Europe doesn’t move quickly, it risks not only another decade of underwhelming economic growth and being knocked around by the likes of Washington and Beijing; it risks a populist revolt that will slow the momentum toward cohesion and perhaps reverse it. Right now, there exists a constellation of constructive leaders at the heart of Europe rowing hard in the direction of cohesion reform and defense sovereignty. After the French presidential election in 2027, which the far-right National Rally may win, and German elections in 2029 at the latest, the political landscape could be much less propitious. A more complicated question is how much Europe should reasonably de-risk from a post-Trump United States. Spending more and cohesively on defense is a given, but should Europe embark on a long-term and costly endeavor to build parallel systems for space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance rather than depend on Washington? Similarly, how realistic is the drive toward technology sovereignty and the development of European champions in areas like cloud computing, where the United States has a near insuperable advantage? Unfortunately, Marsh leaves these important questions unasked and unanswered. The good news for Europe is that becoming a better and more helpful ally to the United States over the long run, establishing more geopolitical independence, and standing up to China and a revanchist Russia all require the same general playbook: breaking down internal market barriers, making more progress on capital markets union, establishing a robust economic security framework, and creating an independent and cohesive defense capability. Uniquely to Europe, these reforms present a well-understood—albeit politically challenging—opportunity to supercharge growth. No other major market—including the United States—has such easily identifiable economic boosters available. In short, opportunity beckons for Europe and the question is not whether the continent can survive; it’s whether Europeans can muster the political will and urgency to meet the moment.

February 20, 2026 / 1:57 PM EST / CBS News To be recognized as one of the best forex brokers in the USA, a brokerage needs to give you a large number of currency pairs, low spreads, minimal costs, and the best trading platforms with analysis tools. Strong customer service and education resources are essential, too. This list of top brokers for U.S.-based traders can help you narrow your options and make your choice. Here are the top eight best brokers for U.S. traders, updated for 2026: All these brokers listed are regulated by both the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and by the National Futures Association (NFA) making them suitable for U.S. traders. The sole exception is eToro, which is regulated by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) within the USA. TradingView awarded OANDA as \"Broker of the Year\" – making this award-winning broker a worthy winner for this list. The reasons OANDA is highly rated include competitive commission-free spreads with low costs and a large range of currency pairs. Support for top trading platforms like MetaTrader 4, its own OANDA Trade platform and TradingView are other reasons that make OANDA notable. OANDA gives you 68 different forex pairs to trade with – among the largest number from any of the brokers appearing on this list. These 68 pairs include all of the majors (aka the most commonly traded currency pairs) along with minor, exotic pairs and cross pairs. This variety gives you access to different volatility levels. In addition to Forex, OANDA also works with Paxos, giving you access to cryptocurrency instruments. Access to the Paxos iBit exchange via OANDA software allows you to trade popular currency pairs like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. In partnership with Wedbush, OANDA makes it easy to trade on the futures market. Types of futures available include nano, micro and e-mini contracts which can be used to buy a wide range of products. These products include U.S. indices, agriculturals, financials, commodities and precious metals like gold. To get started trading futures, OANDA includes an expedited account opening process. For high-volume traders in the U.S., OANDA also offers its Elite Trader Program, which can further reduce your overall trading costs. If you trade at least $10 million in notional volume per month, you become eligible for rebates that range from $5 to $17 per million traded, depending on your volume tier. This rebate is paid directly as cash back, effectively lowering your cost per trade on top of OANDA's already tight spreads. If you are a trader moving significant volume, these rebates can translate into double-digit percentage reductions in total trading fees, making OANDA one of the most cost-effective choices for active U.S. forex traders. In the US, OANDA also offers Core Spreads + Commission pricing (similar to Raw style accounts). For example, the minimum spread on EUR/USD is 0.4 (average 0.5), and the commission is $5/100K units. These commissions are lower than OANDA's nearest competitor, Forex.com, which charges $7/100K USD in volume. They achieve lower spreads by sourcing them straight from the banks themselves. In other words, there's no internal liquidity created by the broker and no one at OANDA with the power to alter the pricing of your trades. OANDA gives you a few platform options to choose from: MetaTrader 4 (MT4), OANDA Trade, and TradingView. MetaTrader 4 offers 30 technical indicators, 23 analytical objects and 9 timeframes. You can also customize your indicators using EAs. MetaTrader 4 is the most popular and used mainstream platform in the market. Justin Grossbard from CompareForexBrokers cited MT4's Expert Advisors, or EAs, as one of the platform's strongest features. \"These features are bots that can automate your trades for you. You can use the MetaQuotes coding language to create your own customized bot. Or you can do what I do, and either buy a free EA or download one from the Marketplace.\" OANDA also gives you even more EAs, and 28 technical analysis tools, through the MT4 Premium Upgrade. There's also the MT4 Orderbook Indicator, exclusive to OANDA. OANDA Trade is the broker's platform, and it integrates Advanced Charts by TradingView to give you more than 65 technical indicators and drawing tools. Things like Autochartist's automated chart pattern recognition and the Economic Overlay help you to stay on top of the latest market movements. You can also use TradingView to execute trades. This is part of OANDA's partnership with TradingView, giving you the opportunity to use advanced charts by TradingView in OANDA Trade or simply use the TradingView platform itself. TradingView is one of the best platforms available for more advanced traders, largely thanks to plenty of indicators and analysis tools. There are more than 400 indicators built into the platform, as well as more than 110 smart drawing tools. Pine Script is TradingView's coding language, which you can use to create your indicators. If you have programming experience, you will be able to create these indicators with just a couple of lines of code. There is no minimum deposit with OANDA, so you can start trading with any amount of money. Multiple payment methods are available including Debit/Visa, Debit/Mastercard, ACH transfers and wire transfers. These options are also offered for withdrawals. If you are a high-volume trader, OANDA has a discount program called the \"Elite Trader Program.\" This program has five different tiers with a monthly trading volume of $10 million to qualify for the lowest tier. This lowest tier gives you a rebate of $5.00 for each million traded, rising to $7.00 on the second tier, then $10.00, $15.00, and, finally, $17.00. OANDA states that the $17.00 rebate can cut your costs by 34% on average. There are other benefits including free VPS, discounted rates for third-party tools, regular interest payments on unused margin over $10,000, additional content and trading events, and personal support from a dedicated relationship manager. OANDA is the best broker overall for U.S. traders. The tight spreads which are consistently lower than the industry average are an excellent point of difference for this broker. The support for MetaTrader 4 is another positive aspect, although the proprietary OANDA Trade platform is excellent, too. OANDA's platform is also one of the most intuitive pieces of trading software around, offering a gentle learning curve for beginners. FOREX.com is one of the most popular forex brokers in the United States. The broker's most outstanding feature is its low spreads, thanks to its RAW account, which gives you access to interbank trading rates and spreads as low as zero pips with a fixed commission fee. Forex.com offers two account types: the Standard Account with no commission but wider spreads and the RAW Account with tighter spreads plus a commission fee. The RAW Account's commission is $7 (each way) for every $100,000 you trade, giving you much tighter spreads. In January 2026, FOREX.com was offering a 0.0 pip spread on the EUR/USD pair through the RAW Account. Spreads with the standard account start from 1.2 pips and have no commission. Products available to trade include 82 Forex pairs along with futures and options. To trade the latter, you will need to sign up with StoneX Futures and use the NinjaTrader platform. FOREX.com gives you the Active Trader Program, designed to support and reward high-volume traders. The program provides cash rebates that increase as your monthly trading volume does, reducing trading costs by up to 15%. FOREX.com gives you a selection of different trading platforms. This includes their proprietary platform, as well as the ever-popular MetaTrader 4 (MT4), MetaTrader 5 (MT5), TradingView and NinjaTrader (for futures trading) software. You'll be able to use the broker's platform either straight through your web browser or on an Android or iOS mobile app. With this platform, FOREX.com has gone a similar route to OANDA, enhancing the capability of its software with TradingView's tools. This means you get more than 80 technical indicators, 50 drawing tools, 14 timeframes and multiple chart types. As well as the broker's platform, you've also got MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5. MT4 ensures you have the essential trading analysis tools for trading while MT5 is an upgrade since it has a richer range of analysis tools like 21 timeframes and over 80 indicators. Both platforms support expert advisors, allowing you to build your own automations and custom indicators. TradingView is another excellent platform that you can use to trade through the Forex.com brokerage. There are over 400 built-in indicators and strategies here, with Volume Profile indicators, Candlestick pattern recognition and more than 100,000 public indicators. The platform's Pine Script coding language enables you to build your indicators if you are looking to execute a more advanced strategy and have some coding experience. There are useful tools available to you when you trade through FOREX.com . Trading Central is one of the leading technical analysis providers in the U.S. market, while SMART trading signals give you real-time ideas as you develop your strategy. Other tools include pivot points and traders sentiment. It's the low spreads on the RAW Account that really stand out here. The fact that you can gain spreads as low as zero pips is really going to help you keep your costs down when you trade. The Active Trader Program with its cash rebates is strong, plus there's support for MT4, MT5 and all the additional tools. Interactive Brokers (IBKR) , an automated global electronic broker, offers multi-asset trading services to clients, all from a single unified account. As a US resident you can trade futures, bonds, and forecast contracts, or invest in stocks, ETFs, and options, and more, on 160+ global markets from a single account. Interactive Brokers is the lowest fee broker, but their platform and customer service is not geared towards beginner traders. It can take months to adjust to their trading platform and trading flow logic, but recent upgrades have dramatically improved their trading app and functionality. If you are looking to trade more than just forex and want the low institutional-like fees, then IBKR is the right choice for your needs. The developers at tastyfx designed their trading systems and interfaces for beginner traders, so everything is very clearly laid out and easy to find. The broker also keeps trading simple by only offering Forex pairs for trading, but with nearly 82 pairs available, the range is impressive. These pairs start from 1.2 pips and have no commissions. The range of trading platforms tastyfx offers is impressive, with four platforms to choose from, it is more than every other broker on this list. With this broker you can choose from tastyfx's own platform, MetaTrader 4 (MT4), MT5, TradingView and ProRealTime. The proprietary platform comes with advanced charts from TradingView which include 80 technical indicators, 14 time interval and 50 drawing tools. Along with 100% of trades being executed in under one second and an average execution speed of 0.002 seconds make tastyfx excellent for technical analysis. MT4 and MT5 have already been discussed and are top platforms to consider, especially for automations and creating custom indicators. TradingView platform is also available and this platform has even more charting features plus social trading. The last platform, ProRealTime has automation capability and a rich range of charts to choose from but does require a subscription or minimum trades per month for free access. tastyfx's 'Learn' offers resources, including evergreen articles, live training sessions, interactive webinars, a demo account, a free economic calendar and analytical tools. If you need a broker with good forex education materials, tastyfx may be the top choice. tastyfx makes the list because it offers the best range of trading platforms. The education features, demo account and intuitive interfaces make it great for newcomers, while 82 Forex pairs make it an excellent choice for Forex trading. The main advantage of Schwab is its customer support, which is run by a service team that knows the markets well, is based in the United States, and can answer questions quickly and satisfactorily. There's no minimum deposit when on the trading account and you also won't incur any fees for adding or withdrawing money. There are no commissions on the broker's spreads unless you are using broker-assisted trading. Although Schwab's Standard Account spreads start at 1.0 pip, they average out at around 1.40. One of the strongest features of Schwab is the thinkorswim trading platform available on desktop (one of the few available on Apple Mac), web and mobiles. This software stands out due to their technical analysis tools which is over 400 in total plus 20 drawing tools. You can also create your own algorithms, watchlists and custom indicators using Thinkscripts. In May 2024, Schwab formally acquired TD-AmeriTrade, this acquisition means you get the best of both brokers. In addition to the thinkorswim platform, you get an extensive trading education suite which includes Schwab Coaching™, paperMoney and insights with the Schwab Network. You also get Forex, stocks and ETF trading with $0 commission plus $2.25 per contract for futures. The U.S.-based support desk is staffed by professionals with direct experience trading who provide very fast response times, around the clock, throughout the trading week. Live chat is one of the most popular methods to get support from the broker, but you can also use dedicated telephone support lines including standard brokerage services, TTY for the hearing impaired, and lines for Spanish, Mandarin or Cantonese. Knowledgeable customer support, available 24 hours a day during the trading week, is what earned Schwab a place on this list. If you value U.S.-based support, this could be a good choice for you. thinkorswim is another plus point for the broker. The platform is a strong option, thanks to good testing and market research tools, although it's unfortunate that the broker doesn't support MetaTrader 4 or TradingView. eToro is very much based around copy and social trading, which means you'll be looking at what leading traders are doing and copying their market movements. The CopyTrader system lets you find other traders to copy and then mirror their trades. The filtering tools are useful here, as you can narrow down your search based on risk level, asset class and other criteria. If you are a successful trader yourself, you can earn additional income through the eToro Popular Investor Program. By becoming a trader that others want to copy, you can gain 1.5% of all the capital used to copy your positions – provided you meet eToro's criteria. Away from their offerings as a retail foreign exchange dealer, eToro can help you build your long-term investment portfolio with ETFs and stocks. The platform offers 2,083 stocks and 269 ETFs across various sectors. There are also more than 24 cryptocurrencies available, ranging from Bitcoin and Ethereum to altcoins. This is another opportunity to diversify your portfolio, this time with the emerging assets in crypto. The main reason to choose eToro is the platform's CopyTrader system. If you would prefer to copy the trades of others, rather than build your own strategy, eToro is a good choice. You can also earn money through eToro's Popular Investor Program if other traders copy your successful trades. Trading.com is aimed squarely at the forex market. The broker provides a specialized forex trading account for U.S. clients with over 70 currency pairs, no commission fees and a low minimum deposit. The T1 Account gives you access to more than 70 currency pairs with no commission, using U.S. dollars as the base currency and requiring a low minimum deposit starting at $50. Ross Collins, a senior analyst at CompareForexBrokers, explains the leverage options available. \"Leverage is available in the U.S. and varies depending on whether it's a major, minor or exotic currency pair you are trading,\" Ross says. \"For instance, if your trading strategy involves a major currency pair like EUR/USD, Trading.com will offer a maximum leverage of 50:1. If you are trading an exotic currency pair like the USD/TRY, your leverage will be limited to 4:1,\" he continues. Trading.com gives you the choice of using their proprietary platform or MetaTrader 5. The proprietary web trader platform and mobile app are perhaps a little basic for some traders. MetaTrader 5 is the better option, giving you web trader and mobile app options plus a suite of sophisticated charting and research tools. The broker offers 70 currency pairs, covering major, minor and exotic forex instruments, allowing for a diverse forex strategy. MetaTrader 5 support strengthens the broker's position. Plus500 Futures is a very strong choice if you're into futures trading, which can be a tricky form of trading to get into. It's made easier by the fact that the Plus500 brokerage gives you some intuitive platforms to work with. You've got micro and mini futures contracts available to you. This is a great feature, as you'll be able to open a position with a lower margin when you use these contracts. You can trade futures contracts using assets like forex, cryptocurrencies, agriculture, metals, interest rates, energy and equity indices. One thing that often puts people off futures is the minimum day trading margins. With Plus500, though, these margins stay low. Opening a micro Bitcoin future will require that you put up just $100 in margin, meaning you've got easy access to crypto futures. As a broker, Plus500 offers a gentle and accessible introduction to futures trading. The tools are designed to be easy to use, and the micro and mini contracts mean you can get started without risking too much of your capital. The best forex broker for U.S. retail traders overall is OANDA. OANDA gives you well-rounded trading conditions and some of the strongest features across several different categories. Its range of forex pairs is one of the broadest from any of the brokers listed here, with 68 currency instruments. The proprietary platform combines an intuitive set of interfaces with advanced trading tools, backed up by support for MetaTrader 4. The regulated forex brokers on this list might offer several different accounts. But the most common account types you'll see repeatedly are Standard Accounts, RAW Spread Accounts and Demo Accounts. With a Standard Account, there's no commission. Instead, there's a wider spread. The broker makes its money off this spread. With a RAW Account, the spread is lower. You'll have to pay a commission on this type of account. Finally, the Demo Account. This is where you will practice making trades without the risk. It's really important that you use your Demo Account to get used to using the broker's tools and features. Then, and only then, you can open one of the live accounts and trade. Yes, it is perfectly legal to trade forex in the United States, as long as the broker is properly regulated. It is the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that regulates the industry and brokers should also be members of the National Futures Association (NFA). All of the brokers on this list have both accreditations. MetaTrader 4 (MT4) is the most popular forex trading platform worldwide among retail investors. The platform gives you an interface that is highly user-friendly, as well as a strong mobile app. MT4's Expert Advisors (EAs) are also strong and are some of the best and most diverse automated trading bots available to you. MetaTrader 5 (MT5) builds on MT4, with advanced indicators and enhanced charting tools. TradingView is another platform offered by top forex brokers, particularly for more advanced traders. You'll get access to a huge range of over 100 indicators and a wealth of charting tools. OANDA Corporation is authorized to provide specific financial services and is regulated by the CFTC/NFA. OANDA is a member firm of the NFA (Member ID: 0325821). CFDs like foreign currency contracts for difference are not available to U.S. residents. Trading in digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, is especially risky and is only for individuals with a high risk tolerance and the financial ability to sustain losses. OANDA Corporation is not party to any transactions in digital assets and does not custody digital assets on your behalf. All digital asset transactions occur on the Paxos Trust Company exchange. Any positions in digital assets are custodied solely with Paxos and held in an account in your name outside of OANDA Corporation. Digital assets held with Paxos are not protected by SIPC. Paxos is not an NFA member and is not subject to the NFA's regulatory oversight and examinations. Trading on leverage always increases the risk you face, and can result in losing money quickly. We advise that you consider very carefully whether leveraged trading, or any form of trading, is right for you. Seek independent financial advice and ensure you fully understand the risks involved before you begin trading. Futures trading is provided by Wedbush Futures, a Division of Wedbush Securities Inc. (\"Wedbush\"). Wedbush is a Futures Commission Merchant and Registered Broker-Dealer. Futures trading involves the substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for all investors. Each investor must consider whether this is a suitable investment since you may lose all of or more than your initial investment. © 2026 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved."

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid NEW YORK, Feb 20 : U.S. stocks advanced on Friday and Treasury yields rose as investors absorbed a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court striking down President Trump's tariffs, while also parsing a weak GDP report and higher-than-expected inflation data. All three major U.S. stock indexes moved higher immediately following the Supreme Court's decision. All three indexes posted gains on the week. Europe's STOXX 600 closed at an all-time high following the ruling while gold prices continued to advance. The Supreme Court's 6-3 ruling struck down Trump's sweeping tariffs enacted under a law meant for use in national emergencies, and has widespread implications for the global economy.

Before Wall Street's opening bell, the Commerce Department released its advance take on fourth-quarter GDP, which showed the U.S. economy grew at a sharply decelerated 1.4 per cent on a quarterly annualized basis in the last months of 2025.

U.S. crude fell 0.06 per cent to settle at $66.39 per barrel, while Brent settled at $71.76 per barrel, up 0.14 per cent on the day. \"There's a belief that tariffs have actually hurt the economy, and maybe we see that in these weak GDP numbers that we got earlier today,\" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York. \"Striking down of these tariffs will benefit corporate bottom lines, corporate earnings,\" Ghriskey said, adding that the decision \"has ramifications across the economic spectrum but there's got to be a lot of disruption, and we’ll have to see the reaction from the White House.\" Trump angrily responded to the court's ruling that he did not have the power to unilaterally set tariffs on imports, vowing a new 10 per cent levy. Before Wall Street's opening bell, the Commerce Department released its advance take on fourth-quarter GDP, which showed the U.S. economy grew at a sharply decelerated 1.4 per cent on a quarterly annualized basis in the last months of 2025. Its separate Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the inflation gauge favored by the U.S. Federal Reserve, revealed price growth heated up in December. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 230.81 points, or 0.47 per cent, to 49,625.97, the S&P 500 rose 47.62 points, or 0.69 per cent, to 6,909.51 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 203.34 points, or 0.90 per cent, to 22,886.07. European stocks reached a new record high after the Supreme Court ruling and marked their biggest weekly jump since early January. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 5.73 points, or 0.55 per cent, to 1,052.94. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.84 per cent, while Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 20.96 points, or 0.84 per cent. Emerging market stocks rose 5.04 points, or 0.32 per cent, to 1,568.38. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed higher by 0.18 per cent, to 802.69, while Japan's Nikkei fell 642.13 points, or 1.12 per cent, to 56,825.70. Gold prices advanced as investors digested the soft GDP report and Trump's announcement of fresh tariffs following the Supreme Court ruling. Rising U.S.-Iran tensions also supported demand for the safe-haven metal. Spot gold rose 1.92 per cent to $5,095.19 an ounce. U.S. gold futures rose 1.91 per cent to $5,071.00 an ounce. U.S. Treasury yields rose following the Supreme Court's ruling. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes rose 0.8 basis points to 4.083 per cent, from 4.075 per cent late on Thursday. The 30-year bond yield rose 2 basis points to 4.7244 per cent from 4.704 per cent late on Thursday. The 2-year note yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations for the Federal Reserve, rose 1 basis point to 3.48 per cent, from 3.47 per cent late on Thursday. The dollar turned lower after the top U.S. court's tariff decision, but was still on track for its biggest weekly gain since October. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, fell 0.14 per cent to 97.75, with the euro up 0.11 per cent at $1.1785.

    "content": "MetaTrader 5 running inside a real Windows VM (Docker + QEMU/KVM) with a REST API slapped on top for programmatic trading. No Wine bullshit, no janky workarounds - a legit Windows environment running the full MT5 terminal in portable mode. Supports multiple brokers and multiple accounts on the same VM simultaneously. Each terminal gets its own Python API process on its own port. Run two FTMO challenges at once, or mix brokers - whatever you need. This is a tool for automating trades. If you blow your account, that's on you. Use demo accounts first, test your shit, and don't come crying when your algo buys the top. The container is configured with a 512M memory limit but a 5G memswap limit — so the VM runs mostly on swap. Sounds cursed, works fine. Windows + MT5 are not latency-sensitive enough for this to matter. tiny11 + our debloat script idles at ~1.4 GB RAM, and MT5 + the Python API barely add anything on top of that. noVNC is there so you can watch the installation progress and confirm everything started up. After that, forget the UI exists and just hit the REST API. This is 4 MT5 terminals (RoboForex, 2x TeleTrade, FTMO) running simultaneously on 2 virtual CPUs with only 512M of real RAM — the rest lives in swap. CPU spikes to 100% during startup while all terminals and APIs initialize at once, then drops to ~15% idle. Total memory usage: 2.1 GB, all comfortably handled by swap. You could easily run 10+ terminals in a single container like this. First run downloads tiny11 (stripped-down Windows 11, ~4 GB), installs it (~10 min), then sets up Python + MT5 automatically. After that, boots in ~1 min. Go grab a coffee on the first run. Your broker credentials. Organized by broker, then account name: Defines which terminals to run. Each entry gets its own MT5 terminal instance and its own API process on a dedicated port: Each terminal installs to <broker>/base/ and gets copied to <broker>/<account>/ at startup so multiple accounts of the same broker don't step on each other. Extra Python packages you want in the VM. MetaTrader5 and flask are already in there. Custom commands that run on every VM boot before MT5 starts. Shove whatever Windows setup shit you need in here. Dump your broker MT5 installers here. Name them mt5setup-<broker>.exe and each one gets its own portable install automatically. Each terminal's API runs on its configured port (from terminals.json ). Default: http://localhost:6542 POST /terminal/init and POST /terminal/shutdown : The API auto-initializes on first request. You almost never need to call these manually. GET /symbols/:symbol — full symbol info: There's a shitload of fields — these are the ones you'll actually use: GET /symbols/:symbol/rates — array of OHLCV candles: Timeframes: M1 M2 M3 M4 M5 M6 M10 M12 M15 M20 M30 H1 H2 H3 H4 H6 H8 H12 D1 W1 MN1 time is the candle open time, unix epoch seconds. GET /symbols/:symbol/ticks — array of ticks: GET /positions — array of position objects: type 0 = buy, 1 = sell. profit is unrealized P&L. PUT /positions/:ticket — move your stop loss / take profit: DELETE /positions/:ticket — close that shit: All fields optional. volume defaults to full position, deviation defaults to 20. GET /orders — array of pending order objects: type : 0=BUY, 1=SELL, 2=BUY_LIMIT, 3=SELL_LIMIT, 4=BUY_STOP, 5=SELL_STOP. state : 1=placed, 2=canceled, 3=partial, 4=filled, 5=rejected, 6=expired. Required: symbol , type , volume . Everything else is optional. price gets auto-filled for market orders. Fill policies: FOK , IOC (default), RETURN Expiration types: GTC (default), DAY , SPECIFIED , SPECIFIED_DAY PUT /orders/:ticket — change your mind on a pending order: What comes back from POST/PUT/DELETE on orders and positions: retcode 10009 = you're good.

History order object (completed/cancelled orders): state 4 = filled, 2 = canceled, 5 = rejected, 6 = expired. volume_current 0 = fully filled. type : 0 = buy, 1 = sell. entry : 0 = opening, 1 = closing. profit is 0 for entries, actual realized P&L for exits. The API gives you raw market data — it doesn't do TA. If you need indicators, grab the candles from here and crunch them yourself. There's a full working example in examples/python/ using pandas-ta with ATR, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, MFI, Stochastic, ADX, VWAP, and moving averages. Check out indicators.py for the individual indicator functions and signals.py for signal detection. Use them as building blocks for your own shit. API ports are determined by config/terminals.json .

    "content": "PALM BEACH, Fla. — Attending World Liberty Financial’s forum at Mar-a-Lago felt less like a high-powered summit and more like an intimate gathering — if the guest list included people who control trillions in assets and the future of finance. Tucked beneath chandeliers and gold-painted trim, the guest list read like a who’s who of the industry’s old guard and rising disruptors. There were no name tags needed. Everyone seemed to know everyone, or at least know someone who did. Conversations floated from the future of finance to how it might fix what’s been broken in the past — ambitious visions of tokenized assets, regulatory overhauls, and reimagined capital markets. But just as easily, the talk turned to the upcoming FIFA World Cup tournament and press-on nails, courtesy of a few unexpected names who probably had no business being there, and yet somehow made the whole thing feel even more surreal. The event was not targeted toward an exclusively U.S. audience; attendees hailed from a number of countries. Several attendees flew from Consensus Hong Kong last week directly to Palm Beach to attend the World Liberty Forum. One attendee said they had flown in on Wednesday morning from ETHDenver, and several others said they would be flying to the Colorado conference following the forum. In any other context, the event would seem to be a typical crypto conference; speakers from traditional financial backgrounds explaining how they're using blockchain or why they're discussing crypto to a dimly lit room. However, the backdrop loomed: This was a conference put on by World Liberty Financial, the crypto company launched and owned in part by the family of U.S. President Donald Trump, held at his golf club Mar-a-Lago, with several attendees tied to his business interests. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, in his first U.S. appearance since receiving a pardon from Trump, was spotted at the event. Goldman Sachs' David Solomon joked on stage that he was there because his client had requested his presence. Many of the panels themselves were high-level; World Liberty Financial co-founder Alex Witkoff asked U.S. Senator Ashley Moody to walk the audience through her background, or Eric Trump and Donald Trump, Jr. reiterating their past grievances with the banks. \"It was forced and maybe opportunistic but we lived a life that opened our eyes to maybe how corrupt the system was … banks [canceled our accounts] for no reason other than my father was wearing a hat that said 'Make America Great Again,'\" Eric Trump claimed. \"We realized how antiquated finance was, how punitive finance was.\" Amid these sessions, some speakers walked through their arguments for the digital assets sector. Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson laid out the rationale for the U.S. dollar remaining the global reserve currency, saying the European Union was too uncoordinated for the euro to take the dollar's place and other currencies just didn't meet the moment. \"About 50% of trade today is done in dollars, another 30% is in the euros, [but] there's no single European debt market. They can't even coordinate around the euro … so that's not going to be the next reserve,\" she said. China's renminbi and India's rupee are contenders, but neither is free-floating, and so that makes it unlikely either of those currencies can take on the role, she said. \"As long as people are still looking for their stablecoin to be backed by the most risk-free currency, it's going to be the dollar,\" she said. Many of the panels nevertheless only had a passing focus on digital assets themselves. The audience reflected this, with crowds mingling outside the actual room to chat during several panels. It wouldn’t have been a Trump gathering without the biggest real estate moguls in the room — and that’s when tokenization (putting assets on blockchain) became a topic. Hotel billionaire Barry Sternlicht, whose Starwood Capital manages over $125 million in assets under management, said the firm was ready to tokenize real-world assets such as real estate, but continues to be unable to do so given the regularity uncertainty. Similarly, Kevin O’Leary told listeners that sovereign wealth funds, with whom he speaks regularly, won’t touch crypto because they’re afraid of the regulatory risk that comes with it in the U.S. From O’Leary to Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon to FIFA president Gianni Infantino, if the day’s lineup were ranked by celebrity status, the organizers surely saved the best for last — and probably the least relevant. Nicki Minaj closed out the event as the final panelist, but the first that caused half the room to take out their phones to snap a picture. Her presence may not make sense in the context of finance or crypto specifically — when moderator Alex Bruesewitz informed her that people gathered to talk about a new innovation in finance, she said she “can like it\" — but given her recently developed close relationship with President Donald Trump, it wasn’t entirely surprising to see her support the family’s event. The World Liberty Forum wasn’t just a conference, it was the kind of room where fortunes are steered, not pitched, and where the side chatter was just as telling as the main agenda.

Our easier task is to poke holes in the dominant narratives supplied by our media. This article saved into your bookmarks. Click here to view your bookmarks. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio received a standing ovation at last week’s Munich Security Conference in Germany after delivering a speech the conference chair, retired German diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger, effusively described as “reassuring.” Speaking for the entire audience, he drew Rubio’s attention to “the sigh of relief” heard “through this hall.” The timing was perfect. Europe was desperately looking for reassurance from a nation whose image had turned diabolical after a special operation, the abduction of sitting Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in his bedroom, was followed by several weeks of what Europeans will remember as the great Greenland standoff. Though evoked as early as his January 2025 inauguration, US President Donald Trump began 2026 by making Greenland the scene of his latest geopolitical psychodrama. He confirmed a personal ambition many had written off as simply wacky. The master of the Oval Office threatened to militarily capture a vast piece of European territory, apparently to satisfy his appetite for Lebensraum (living space). Or should we call it Wirtschaftsraum (economic space), because most people don’t see Greenland as a space for living? Unlike Gaza or even North Korea , it seems unlikely that the great New York real estate mogul addicted to orange makeup has a plan for building another of his stunning beach resorts on Greenland’s arctic shores. Looking back, it’s relatively easy to understand why Adolf Hitler felt somewhat confined between Germany’s post-World War I borders. But can a credible case be made that the United States lacks either living or economic space? None of the Europeans in the hall in Munich failed to understand the reason for Ischinger’s feeling of reassurance. At the same conference in 2025, newly installed US Vice President JD Vance delivered a speech that shocked and humiliated the audience. It played out as a frontal assault on Europe’s social, political and economic culture. The dominant mood in the room was apprehension. After the Greenland episode, many Europeans had decided that the Trump administration had become dominated by what California Congressman Ro Khanna has called “the Epstein class.” The New York Times columnist Ezra Klein glossed this epithet as Khanna’s term for “the rich and powerful people who act and think like they’re above the law and, and perhaps above morality.” In other words, a den of demons singing to the same hymnal as sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. The Europeans were thus in dire need of the very relief and reassurance Ischinger acknowledged. Rubio obliged them by repeatedly reminding his audience that Europe and the US were yoked “together” — a word that appeared 28 times in his speech — by a “shared history, Christian faith, culture, heritage, language, ancestry, and the sacrifices our forefathers made together for the common civilization to which we have fallen heir.” (Impertinent question for the Epstein class: Do heirs always fall?) If each of the items in Rubio’s list of factors of togetherness had anything like the force he attributes to them, his argument might sound not just reassuring but even convincing. Alas, no one needed to be convinced, it was enough to be “reassured.” At one point, when the US Secretary of State rhetorically asserted that “we will always be a child of Europe,” the audience broke into applause. For a brief moment, they may have felt comforted by the idea that Rubio had put them in the role of “ Daddy ,” a term NATO chief Mark Rutte had previously applied to Trump. But do any of Rubio’s claims about a shared cultural and political identity stand up, even to superficial scrutiny? He invokes a sense of “shared history,” but how much of that history has been truly shared? When you think about it, what does the sharing of history mean? The US shared much of its history with native American tribes and with African slave traders. But has that translated into a sense of mutual purpose among the participants? Much of the history “shared” by the US and Europe — but also among the European nations themselves — has been dominated by war, rivalry, suspicion and competition for empire. Shared conflict creates familiarity, but it rarely produces unbreakable bonds or the sense of being united in a common vision of the future. Throughout the speech, Rubio stresses the religious bond. But is it logical to claim that the constitutional separation of church and state in the US combined with what everyone recognizes as the radical and practically total secularization of nearly all European nations can signify a sharing of “Christian faith” across the Atlantic ocean? Yes, you can find churches that built over many centuries, but if only a smattering of the faithful visit them for anything other than touristic reasons, and if their faith turns out to manifest itself as little more than a compulsive repetition of inherited habits, can any rational observer take the existence of a transatlantic civilization united by the Christian faith seriously? Just like Vance a year ago, Rubio berates the practice of welcoming immigrants, suspected of diluting the purity of the “civilization.” What he’s hinting at here and elsewhere in his speech is what he perceives as the racial identity associated with European roots: whiteness. Rubio cites his own case: the man everyone identifies as the scion of a Cuban family, who can prove his legitimacy by tracing his ancestry back to two European sources Piedmont-Sardinia (Italy) and Saville (Spain). Then there’s his evocation of “culture, heritage, language, ancestry.” What does that mean in today’s European context? Even after constituting itself initially as a “Common Market” and then as the “European Union,” the concept of Europe remains that of a collection of geographically contiguous nations. It represents a bewildering diversity of elements, so much so that the “Union” is perceived effectively and embarrassingly for its own citizens as little more than a sprawling and generally annoying bureaucracy. Is the idea of defense the only key to creating a sense of European unity? That seems to reflect the dominant thinking of the current generation of leaders. The Russia–Ukraine conflict has revealed that the only identifiable force preventing the Union from falling into political incoherence is its nations’ historical dependence on the US nuclear umbrella and the dollar. The wizards of Europe created the euro in the hope of rivaling the dollar, but that experiment has failed . To quote former Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis: Europe is “a continent united by different languages” and “divided by a common currency.” Rubio’s mission was to convince his audience that the European relationship with the US is reassuringly solid. Ischinger appears convinced, but are the rest of his colleagues in the room? Trump 2.0’s frankly aggressive policies and unpredictable actions across the globe have more than raised eyebrows. European leaders increasingly allude to what should appear obvious: that the vaunted Union has lost its footing. It is held together by the fragile ropes of its increasingly bloated and undemocratic bureaucracy. From a geopolitical point of view, the 27-state confederation based in Brussels, Belgium, functions primarily as a motley collection of US vassal states. It’s the strings that tie the nations to Washington that keep the idea of Europe alive. That may explain why the idea of “strategic autonomy,” initially formulated by General Charles de Gaulle, has once again come to the fore. France’s lame duck President Emmanual Macron first evoked the ambition of achieving Europe’s strategic autonomy after only a few months in office back in 2017. He occasionally returns to the concept, though framing it as an aspiration rather than a viable program. But the concept is desperately needed, even if no one seems capable of implementing it. At the same Munich conference, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned that Washington’s “claim to leadership is disputed, perhaps squandered.” Who can replace the leader? Unless we conclude that Europe’s current “leaders” (who don’t even lead their own nations) are as brainless in reality as the rhetoric they feel continually obliged to spout in public, reaffirming their liberal “values” and commitment to noble causes, it’s doubtful that many of them would echo Ischinger’s feeling of being “reassured” by Rubio’s concentrated but slightly disguised assault on their political culture. Rubio’s tone was tepid in comparison to Vance’s, but in some ways his speech was more aggressive. On two occasions, he excoriated a bugbear he calls “massive welfare states,” as if to say to the Europeans: “How foolish of you to impose universal healthcare on a population that doesn’t deserve it?” Personal insecurity is the psychological pillar of the US economy. It explains American greatness just as the welfare state explains Europe’s inconsequentiality. Most Americans take that as common sense, but even the current roster of inept European leaders understand that the price of stability everywhere in Europe is the maintenance of the web of safeguards the European nations have provided for a population otherwise exposed to domination and exploitation by the Epstein class that rules the US. Europe is currently locked into a lose-lose scenario that was created by US President Joe Biden’s administration and sealed by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s impromptu visit to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv in the spring of 2022. That was the decisive moment when BoJo gave instructions to a captive Ukrainian regime to cancel an initialed peace agreement and prolong a war it could never win. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy no doubt assumed that with the might of NATO behind him, victory was assured. What he was prevented from understanding is that Washington felt no urgency about their mission. What they wanted was regime change in Russia, even if it required years of combat and millions of casualties. Biden made it clear when he repeatedly insisted that it could last “as long as it takes.” The nasty surprise for the Europeans came last year when, having wholeheartedly acted as loyal vassals to Washington, their “benign” overlord, Biden, was replaced by the “malignant” Trump, who promised to end the war within 24 hours, essentially by recognizing the reality on the ground: Ukraine’s military defeat. To prove they weren’t the vassals of a diabolical transatlantic leader, they had to demonstrate to one another that they remained faithful to the agenda of their former angelic overlord, Biden. That inevitably aggravated the sentiment not just of having lost their compass, but also of being nobody’s masters, not even of their own populations. In such circumstances, should we be surprised that the favorab i lity ratings of France’s Macron stand at 16%, Germany’s Merz at 21% and UK’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer at 23%? Should we similarly be surprised that despite a concerted effort to inspire fear of the Russian bear invading Europe — a message enthusiastically endorsed and amplified by Europe’s mainstream media — support for increased defense spending in France has fallen from 40% in 2025 to 28% and in Germany from 37% to 24%? Ischinger may feel reassured, but that doesn’t change the simple fact that European leaders are in a bind. They have lost all credibility with their own electorates. They have been pushed by interests beyond their national borders to commitments that make little sense. They remain stuck in a viral, often hysterical hatred and fear of an imaginary enemy that obliges them to prolong their commitment to a war that has already undermined their own economies and destroyed Ukraine, the object they were recruited to rescue. At the same time, their populations have come to perceive the US — the commanding presence in NATO — as a dangerous adversary. Ischinger’s first question to Rubio was about US commitment to Ukraine. Rubio predictably waffled a meaningless, “reassuring” response. Europe now finds itself in the most awkward situation, abandoned by the US while still taking orders from Washington about who they should hate and refuse to do business with: Russia and China. Talk about Scylla and Charybdis or, more colloquially, a rock and a hard place. And speaking of rocks, now they’re being invited to feel reassured by the comforting fact that Rubio only throws rhetorical rocks and not physical bombs at them. *[ The Devil’s Advocate pursues the tradition Fair Observer began in 2017 with the launch of our “Devil’s Dictionary.” It does so with a slight change of focus, moving from language itself — political and journalistic rhetoric — to the substantial issues in the news.
