  "output": "**1. Key Market Drivers**\n*   **Monetary Policy & Economic Data:** The primary driver is the US Supreme Court striking down sweeping tariffs, followed by the announcement of a new 10% global levy. This creates policy uncertainty and potential trade friction.\n*   **Risk Sentiment:** Mixed signals. Global shares are climbing, indicating firm risk appetite. However, the dollar initially slipped on the SCOTUS ruling but saw strong safe-haven demand earlier in the week, suggesting underlying caution.\n*   **Geopolitics:** US-Iran tensions are noted as a supporting factor for oil and a potential source of market volatility.\n\n**2. Short-Term Outlook (1-3 Days)**\nSlightly bearish for EUR/USD. The immediate market reaction to the SCOTUS ruling was a weaker dollar, but the subsequent announcement of a new 10% levy introduces fresh trade uncertainty. This may limit the euro's upside and could renew demand for the USD as a haven if risk sentiment sours. Price action is likely to be choppy and headline-driven.\n\n**3. Medium-Term Outlook (1-2 Weeks)**\nSideways to bearish. The new tariff landscape creates a headwind for global growth and trade, which typically benefits the US dollar due to its liquidity and safe-haven status. Unless Eurozone data surprises strongly to the upside or the Fed signals a definitively dovish shift, the broader environment favors USD strength, capping EUR/USD rallies.\n\n**4. Trading Bias**\n**Bearish.** The combination of renewed US trade policy uncertainty and the dollar's demonstrated recent strength as a safe-haven (its strongest week since November) points to EUR/USD facing selling pressure on rallies. The path of least resistance is lower within a volatile range.\n\n**5. Main Risks / Alternative Scenarios**\n*   **Risk Rally Sustained:** If global risk appetite holds firm (e.g., driven by strong Nvidia earnings) and US data softens, the dollar's safe-haven bid could fade, leading to a stronger euro.\n*   **ECB Hawkish Surprise:** More hawkish-than-expected commentary from the European Central Bank could provide sustained support for the euro.\n*   **Tariff Details & Retaliation:** The specific details of the new 10% levy and the scale of retaliation from trading partners will be critical. A softer-than-feared implementation could invalidate the bearish view."
