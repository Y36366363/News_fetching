  "output": "**1. Key Market Drivers**\n*   **Monetary Policy & ECB Uncertainty:** Reports of ECB President Lagarde considering an early exit (News 44) introduce political uncertainty, potentially creating a mild headwind for the Euro. Concurrently, ECB's Villeroy notes vigilance on FX impacts on inflation (News 45), signaling discomfort with excessive Euro weakness.\n*   **Risk Sentiment:** Positive, with European and US stocks at record highs (News 38, 39, 42). This typically supports cyclical currencies like the Euro against safe havens, but the rally may be limiting USD demand.\n*   **Geopolitical Tensions:** Jitters are boosting oil and gold (News 38, 39, 42), creating a mixed environment. This can cause sporadic USD strength, but the dominant risk-on equity move is more influential in this snapshot.\n*   **Economic Data:** Secondary focus here. Traders are digesting company earnings and awaiting Fed minutes (News 42). UK inflation data is a GBP story, not a direct EUR driver.\n\n**2. Short-Term Outlook (1-3 Days)**\n**Sideways to Slightly Bearish.** The Lagarde exit rumor (confirmed as a report, not a decision) creates a near-term negative narrative for the Euro, likely capping rallies. Positive risk sentiment offers some counter-support. Expect choppy trade, likely between **$1.1800 - $1.1900**, with a bias toward testing the lower end unless the rumor is formally dismissed.\n\n**3. Medium-Term Outlook (1-2 Weeks)**\n**Sideways with Downside Risk.** The Lagarde story will evolve, potentially leading to speculation on her successor's policy lean (hawkish vs. dovish), keeping EUR volatility elevated. The broader driver will shift to comparative central bank policy signals (ECB vs. Fed). Unless Eurozone data surprises strongly to the upside, the ECB's cautious stance and political uncertainty may keep EUR/USD pressured, **testing support toward $1.1750**.\n\n**4. Trading Bias**\n**Bearish (Cautiously).**\n*   **Primary Reason:** The unexpected political overhang from the Lagarde exit report undermines Euro stability and introduces a new dovish speculation risk.\n*   **Secondary Reason:** The ECB's explicit focus on FX (Villeroy) is typically a reaction to weakness, not strength, acknowledging downward pressure.\n\n**5. Main Risks / Alternative Scenarios**\n*   **Risk-On Extension:** A sustained surge in global equities could overwhelm Euro-specific negatives, driving a short-covering rally back toward **$1.1950+**.\n*   **ECB Pushback:** Strong, coordinated denial of the Lagarde report by ECB officials could quickly reverse the bearish sentiment.\n*   **Dovish Fed Surprise:** If the upcoming Fed minutes are interpreted as markedly dovish, USD weakness could propel EUR/USD higher regardless of Eurozone news.\n*   **Geopolitical Escalation:** A sharp worsening of global tensions could trigger a flight to liquidity into the USD, accelerating EUR/USD declines."
