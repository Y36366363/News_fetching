  "output": "**EUR/USD Forex Analysis**\n\n---\n\n### 1. Key Market Drivers\n\n- **Economic Data:**  \n  - Asia markets, especially China, are reopening strongly, signaling potential global growth support.  \n  - No direct Eurozone or US economic data provided, but positive China reopening may boost risk appetite globally.\n\n- **Monetary Policy:**  \n  - No new ECB or Fed policy updates in the news.  \n  - US dollar pressure noted due to tariff uncertainties and court rulings affecting trade policy.\n\n- **Risk Sentiment:**  \n  - Mixed:  \n    - Positive: China reopening lifts Asian equities, supporting risk-on sentiment.  \n    - Negative: Renewed US tariff threats and trade tensions (Trump’s warnings, tariff turmoil) create uncertainty.  \n  - Dollar weakening due to US tariff legal setbacks and geopolitical tensions (Iran).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Short-term (1–3 days) Outlook\n\n- **Outlook:** Mild EUR/USD upside bias or range-bound with slight bullish tilt.  \n- **Rationale:**  \n  - Dollar softness amid tariff/legal uncertainties and geopolitical risks supports EUR/USD gains.  \n  - China reopening boosts global risk sentiment, reducing safe-haven USD demand.  \n  - Lack of fresh Eurozone data or ECB signals limits strong directional moves.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Medium-term (1–2 weeks) Outlook\n\n- **Outlook:** Sideways to mildly bullish EUR/USD.  \n- **Rationale:**  \n  - Continued US trade tensions and tariff unpredictability likely to keep USD under pressure.  \n  - Eurozone fundamentals and ECB stance remain key; absence of hawkish signals keeps EUR gains moderate.  \n  - Global growth optimism from China reopening may support risk currencies including EUR.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Trading Bias\n\n- **Bias:** Mildly **bullish** EUR/USD.  \n- **Reasoning:**  \n  - Dollar weakness driven by trade policy uncertainty and geopolitical risks.  \n  - Positive risk sentiment from China reopening supports EUR and risk currencies.  \n  - No strong Eurozone or Fed catalysts to reverse trend immediately.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Main Risks / Alternative Scenarios\n\n- **Risks that could invalidate bullish bias:**  \n  - Sudden escalation in US-China trade war or new tariffs that sharply boost USD safe-haven demand.  \n  - Hawkish ECB signals or stronger-than-expected Eurozone data pushing EUR higher rapidly, causing overextension and correction.  \n  - US economic data surprises or Fed tightening expectations strengthening USD.  \n  - Geopolitical de-escalation reducing risk premium, leading to USD rebound.\n\n---\n\n**Summary for Traders:**  \nExpect EUR/USD to trade with a mild bullish bias near-term, supported by dollar softness amid trade and geopolitical uncertainties and positive risk sentiment from China reopening. Monitor US trade developments and Eurozone data closely for potential shifts. Use tight stops given mixed signals and potential for volatility spikes."
