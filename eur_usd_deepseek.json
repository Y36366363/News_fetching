  "output": "**1. Key Market Drivers**\n*   **Risk Sentiment:** Mixed. Positive from China reopening, but negative from renewed US tariff threats and geopolitical tensions (Iran).\n*   **US Dollar Dynamics:** USD is weakening due to a court ruling striking down some US tariffs and general tariff uncertainty.\n*   **Monetary Policy:** Not directly addressed, but a softer USD may reflect market pricing of a less aggressive Fed relative to other central banks if risk-off escalates.\n\n**2. Short-Term Outlook (1-3 Days)**\n**Slightly Bullish EUR/USD.** The immediate driver is USD weakness on tariff-related news (court ruling, Trump warnings). Positive Asian sentiment from China's reopening may provide a temporary risk-on tailwind for the Euro. Expect choppy trading within a 50-70 pip range, biased to the upside.\n\n**3. Medium-Term Outlook (1-2 Weeks)**\n**Sideways to Bearish.** The initial USD sell-off may fade as focus returns to the fundamental divergence between the US and Eurozone economies. Persistent tariff threats and geopolitical risks (Iran) could revive safe-haven USD demand, capping significant Euro gains. The pair likely consolidates or drifts lower unless Eurozone data surprises positively.\n\n**4. Trading Bias**\n**Short-term: Cautiously Bullish.** Medium-term: **Sideways with a bearish tilt.**\n*   **Reasoning:** Short-term momentum favors EUR on a soft USD narrative. However, the medium-term path of least resistance is lower due to superior US economic resilience and the Euro's vulnerability to risk-off flows stemming from the very tariff/geopolitical headlines currently hurting the Dollar.\n\n**5. Main Risks / Alternative Scenarios**\n*   **Risk 1 (Upside for EUR):** A rapid de-escalation of US trade rhetoric or a string of strong Eurozone data could extend the USD correction, pushing EUR/USD higher.\n*   **Risk 2 (Downside for EUR):** An aggressive escalation of US tariff actions or a sharp spike in Iran tensions triggers a strong flight to safety into the USD, overwhelming the current negative tariff impact on the Dollar.\n*   **Risk 3:** The ECB delivers unexpectedly dovish guidance, re-widening the policy divergence with the Fed and pressuring the Euro."
