    "deepseek": "**1. Key Market Drivers**\n* **AI Sector Sentiment:** Negative pressure from \"AI spending fears\" hitting big tech valuations (News 2).\n* **Strategic Investment:** Positive long-term catalyst from Amazon-backed X-Energy securing a key nuclear fuel license, supporting energy needs for AWS/AI (News 6).\n* **Insider Activity:** Small, non-material stock sale by CEO Herrington ($208k), typically neutral but may be noted (News 4).\n* **Sector & Regulatory:** PJM power plan (News 8) could benefit AWS's data center expansion logistics. Broader tech trends (AI summits, digital trust alliances) provide sector context but no direct AMZN catalyst.\n\n**2. Short-Term Outlook (1-3 Days)**\n**Sideways to slightly bearish.** The dominant market narrative is negative for mega-cap tech due to AI spending concerns (News 2), which will likely weigh on AMZN alongside peers. The positive nuclear news is strategic, not earnings-impactful in the near term. Stock likely trades in line with tech sector sentiment.\n\n**3. Medium-Term Outlook (1-2 Weeks)**\n**Sideways with a bullish bias.** The initial AI spending fear may stabilize. AMZN's concrete progress in securing long-term, clean power for its data centers (News 6, 8) is a material competitive advantage that may gain investor attention as a rebuttal to AI cost concerns. This could support relative outperformance.\n\n**4. Trading Bias & Reasoning**\n**Sideways (with a lean to buying dips).**\n*Reasoning:* The negative sector sentiment (AI cost fears) creates near-term headwinds. However, AMZN is actively addressing the core infrastructure challenge (energy) for AI/cloud growth, as shown by the nuclear license. This strategic positioning should provide a floor and make it a relative winner on any sector rebound.\n\n**5. Main Risks & Alternative Scenarios**\n* **Downside Risk:** Broader tech selloff intensifies on poor sector earnings or heightened AI spending fears, overwhelming AMZN-specific positives. A sharp rise in bond yields could pressure valuations further.\n* **Upside Risk:** Market quickly reframes narrative from \"AI spending fears\" to \"AI infrastructure winners,\" with AMZN's energy moves seen as a key moat. A strong broader market rally lifts all tech.\n* **Invalidation:** If AMZN issues guidance suggesting AI capex will severely pressure margins beyond expectations, the bearish sector narrative would dominate.",
    "openai": "**Amazon (AMZN) Stock Analysis Based on Recent News**\n\n---\n\n### 1. Key Market Drivers\n\n- **Earnings & Insider Activity:**  \n  - Amazon CEO Herrington sold $208k in AMZN shares recently (News 4). Insider selling can be perceived as a mild negative signal, though the amount is relatively small and may be routine diversification.\n\n- **Product/Business Developments:**  \n  - Amazon-backed X-Energy received the first nuclear fuel license in 50 years (News 6). This signals Amazon’s strategic diversification into advanced energy sectors, potentially boosting long-term growth narratives.\n  - No direct new product launches or earnings updates reported in the news set.\n\n- **Sector & Market Trends:**  \n  - Big tech stocks are under pressure due to fears around increased AI spending impacting valuations (News 2). This broad tech selloff sentiment could weigh on AMZN short-term.\n  - Global AI summit in India highlights ongoing AI innovation but also intensifies competition (News 1).\n  - PJM plan may accelerate data center power deals (News 8), potentially benefiting Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure growth.\n  - No direct Amazon-specific AI announcements, but sector-wide AI spending concerns are relevant.\n\n- **Macro & Competitive Landscape:**  \n  - Microsoft and Ericsson lead a digital trust alliance (News 5), indicating competitive tech alliances that could pressure Amazon’s cloud and AI ambitions.\n  - Alphabet’s strong investor confidence (News 7) contrasts with tech valuation fears, highlighting mixed sentiment in the sector.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Short-term Outlook (1–3 days)\n\n- **Likely Direction:** Mildly Bearish to Sideways  \n- **Rationale:**  \n  - Recent insider selling and broad tech sector valuation concerns around AI spending create near-term headwinds.  \n  - No positive Amazon-specific catalysts to offset sector weakness immediately.  \n  - Expect some volatility but limited downside given Amazon’s strong fundamentals and diversification.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Medium-term Outlook (1–2 weeks)\n\n- **Likely Direction:** Neutral to Slightly Bullish  \n- **Rationale:**  \n  - The nuclear fuel license news and potential acceleration in data center power deals could gain investor attention, supporting a modest rebound.  \n  - If broader tech sector stabilizes after initial AI spending fears, Amazon may benefit from its AWS and diversification stories.  \n  - Watch for upcoming earnings or economic data releases that could influence sentiment.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Trading Bias\n\n- **Bias:** Neutral / Slightly Bearish Short-term; Neutral to Slightly Bullish Medium-term  \n- **Reasoning:**  \n  - Short-term caution due to sector-wide AI spending fears and insider selling.  \n  - Medium-term potential upside from strategic diversification and infrastructure tailwinds.  \n  - Lack of immediate strong catalysts keeps bias balanced.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Main Risks / Alternative Scenarios\n\n- **Risks That Could Invalidate View:**  \n  - **Negative:**  \n    - Escalation of AI spending fears leading to a broader tech selloff dragging AMZN lower.  \n    - Disappointing upcoming earnings or guidance from Amazon.  \n    - Larger insider selling or negative management commentary.  \n  - **Positive:**  \n    - Strong earnings beat or positive guidance on AWS growth.  \n    - New product launches or AI-related announcements boosting investor confidence.  \n    - Resolution or easing of tech sector valuation concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary for Traders:**  \nExpect cautious trading in the next few days with potential sideways to mild downside pressure. Monitor sector sentiment and any Amazon-specific news closely. Medium-term, look for stabilization and possible upside from diversification and infrastructure growth stories. Maintain a balanced trading stance with tight stops given sector volatility.",
    "gemini": "Okay, here's an analysis of AMZN stock based on the provided news snippets, structured for a trader:\n\n**1. Key Market Drivers:**\n\n*   **AI Spending Fears:** News 2 highlights concerns about excessive AI spending impacting valuations of big tech companies, including Amazon. This is a negative sentiment driver.\n*   **Nuclear Fuel License:** News 6 indicates Amazon's investment in X-Energy, which received a nuclear fuel license. This is a positive long-term driver, potentially reducing energy costs for data centers.\n*   **Data Center Power Deals:** News 8 suggests a PJM plan could accelerate data center power deals. This is a positive for AWS, as it could lead to more efficient and reliable power supply.\n*   **Insider Selling:** News 4 reports Amazon CEO Herrington sold $208k in AMZN stock. While not a huge amount, insider selling can sometimes create negative sentiment.\n*   **India AI Summit:** News 1 mentions India hosting a global AI summit. This is a positive for the AI sector in general, but the direct impact on AMZN is unclear.\n\n**2. Short-Term (1-3 days) Outlook:**\n\n*   Slightly Negative. The AI spending fears and insider selling could create some downward pressure. However, the news is not overwhelmingly negative.\n\n**3. Medium-Term (1-2 weeks) Outlook:**\n\n*   Neutral to Slightly Positive. The positive news regarding X-Energy and data center power deals could offset the AI spending concerns. The overall market sentiment will also play a significant role.\n\n**4. Trading Bias:**\n\n*   **Sideways.** The news presents a mixed picture. The negative sentiment around AI spending is countered by positive developments in energy and data centers. A sideways trading bias is appropriate until more concrete data emerges.\n\n**5. Main Risks/Alternative Scenarios:**\n\n*   **Broader Market Downturn:** A significant market correction could drag AMZN down, regardless of company-specific news.\n*   **Worse-than-Expected AWS Growth:** If AWS growth slows down significantly, it would negatively impact the stock.\n*   **Increased Regulatory Scrutiny:** Increased regulatory pressure on big tech could negatively impact AMZN.\n*   **Positive Earnings Surprise from a Competitor:** A competitor reporting significantly better-than-expected earnings could shift sentiment away from AMZN.\n*   **Unexpectedly High Inflation Data:** Higher-than-expected inflation data could lead to increased interest rates, negatively impacting growth stocks like AMZN."
