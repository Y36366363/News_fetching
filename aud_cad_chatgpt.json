  "output": "**AUD/CAD Forex Analysis**\n\n---\n\n### 1. Key Market Drivers\n\n- **Economic Data:**  \n  No direct recent AUD or CAD-specific economic releases mentioned. However, general risk sentiment and USD movements are influencing commodity currencies like AUD and CAD.\n\n- **Monetary Policy:**  \n  Fed rate cut prospects are fading, supporting USD strength. No direct RBA or BoC updates, but the broader USD trend impacts AUD/CAD.\n\n- **Risk Sentiment:**  \n  - U.S. tariff tensions persist with Trump announcing new tariffs, causing some USD weakness but also geopolitical uncertainty.  \n  - Asian currencies, including the SGD, are strengthening amid risk-on sentiment, which typically supports AUD.  \n  - Treasury yields slightly up, indicating cautious risk appetite.\n\n- **Commodity Influence:**  \n  Gold-related news is prominent but not directly linked to AUD/CAD. However, commodity price trends (oil for CAD, metals for AUD) remain relevant but no fresh data here.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Short-term (1–3 days) Outlook\n\n- **Outlook:** Mild AUD strength vs CAD likely, supported by risk-on sentiment in Asia and USD softness from tariff concerns.  \n- **Drivers:** Slight USD weakness and risk appetite favor AUD over CAD, which is more tied to oil and global trade concerns.  \n- **Expected Range:** AUD/CAD may test resistance near 0.9200, with support around 0.9150.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Medium-term (1–2 weeks) Outlook\n\n- **Outlook:** Sideways to mildly bullish for AUD/CAD, pending clarity on U.S. tariff developments and commodity price movements.  \n- **Drivers:** If tariffs escalate, risk sentiment could deteriorate, pressuring AUD. Conversely, easing tensions or stable commodity prices support AUD/CAD upside.  \n- **Expected Range:** 0.9100–0.9250, with potential volatility spikes around tariff news or economic data releases.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Trading Bias\n\n- **Bias:** Mildly **bullish** on AUD/CAD.  \n- **Reasoning:** Risk-on sentiment in Asia and USD softness provide short-term tailwinds for AUD over CAD. No strong CAD-specific positive drivers currently. However, geopolitical risks cap upside.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Main Risks / Alternative Scenarios\n\n- **Risks that could invalidate bullish bias:**  \n  - Escalation of U.S. tariffs leading to risk-off sentiment, hurting AUD more than CAD.  \n  - Stronger-than-expected Canadian economic data or BoC hawkish signals.  \n  - Sharp commodity price drops (oil for CAD or metals for AUD) altering relative currency strength.  \n  - Renewed USD strength from hawkish Fed or safe-haven demand.\n\n- **Alternative scenario:** If USD rebounds strongly or risk aversion spikes, AUD/CAD could quickly reverse lower, testing 0.9100 or below.\n\n---\n\n**Summary for Traders:**  \nExpect mild AUD/CAD gains near term on risk-on and USD softness, but remain cautious around tariff headlines. Use tight stops and monitor commodity prices and U.S. trade developments closely."
