  "output": "**1. Key Market Drivers**\n*   **Monetary Policy & Economic Data:** Dominant theme is the **US Supreme Court ruling enabling Trump to impose a 15% global tariff**. This is a major fiscal/monetary shock, likely driving Fed expectations and growth differentials.\n*   **Risk Sentiment:** Mixed signals. Global equities are climbing (News 8), suggesting risk appetite. However, the dollar initially saw safe-haven demand (News 7), indicating underlying caution about the tariff's global growth impact.\n\n**2. Short-Term Outlook (1-3 Days): Sideways to Slightly Bearish EUR/USD**\n*   Immediate reaction saw dollar slip (News 7), but it remains strong for the week. Markets are digesting the ruling's implications. Initial risk-on moves (equities up) may cap USD strength, but the tariff's deflationary/demand-dampening effect on Europe and China likely favors the USD as the \"cleanest dirty shirt.\" Expect choppy, headline-driven trading with a bias toward dollar resilience.\n\n**3. Medium-Term Outlook (1-2 Weeks): Bearish EUR/USD**\n*   The tariff implementation is a clear negative for the Eurozone, a large, open, export-dependent economy. It threatens EU growth, complicates ECB policy, and could trigger capital flows into the US. The dollar's status as the primary safe-haven and the US's relatively more closed economy should see it outperform the euro as the tariff reality sets in.\n\n**4. Trading Bias: Bearish (on rallies)**\n*   **Reasoning:** The structural shock of new US tariffs is a greater relative burden for the Eurozone economy than for the US. This should widen growth and interest rate differentials in the USD's favor over the coming weeks. Any short-term EUR/USD rallies on fleeting risk appetite are likely to be sold into.\n\n**5. Main Risks / Alternative Scenarios**\n*   **Risk 1: Aggressive ECB Response.** If the ECB signals a more hawkish stance to combat potential imported inflation from tariffs, EUR could find support.\n*   **Risk 2: US Growth Scare.** If US data deteriorates sharply on tariff fallout, markets may price in aggressive Fed cuts, weakening the USD.\n*   **Risk 3: Escalating Geopolitics.** A significant flare-up in US-Iran tensions (News 8) could cause a broad USD squeeze, boosting EUR/USD temporarily.\n*   **Risk 4: EU Retaliation.** A coordinated, forceful EU trade retaliation could alter the growth impact calculus and limit EUR downside."
