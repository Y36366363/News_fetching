      "content": "February 18, 2026 12:45 ET | Source: Eramet SA Eramet SA\n\nEramet: structural measures to strengthen balance sheet and prepare the future, after a challenging year 2025\n\nIn 2025, global macroeconomic headwinds and core commodities at cyclical lows combined with the weakening of the dollar weighed on the Group’s profitability and cash generation, while our operational performance did not meet our objectives across all operations.\n\nHowever, we reached several key decisive milestones of our strategic roadmap, notably the ramp-up of our lithium production in Centenario. This is an achievement the Eramet team can be proud of, positioning our Group at the heart of the energy transition with a world-class asset. Our achievement in early 2026 of the IRMA 50 performance level by our mineral sands mine in Senegal also marks a major milestone in the Group’s Act for Positive Mining vision.\n\nIn 2026, our priority is to remain focused on improving our operational performance, controlling our costs and investments, with a particular attention to safety. The ReSolution programme provides a rigorous execution framework for these actions, leveraging our world-class assets.\n\nWe have also launched other structural actions, aimed at strengthening our balance sheet, with the full support of the Board of Directors, including a strategic review with asset monetisation options in 2026, as well as a planned equity base strengthening.\n\nDuring this transition, I know I can count on the commitment of all our teams.\n\nIn response to a deteriorated financial situation, and with the support of its Board of Directors, Eramet has implemented a funding plan aimed at improving cash generation and strengthening the balance sheet.\n\nThis plan aims to enable the normalisation of the Group’s credit ratios (gearing and leverage), while securing its liquidity and access to the bond market.\n\nIn the medium term, this enhanced financial flexibility will enable Eramet to seize new growth opportunities.\n\nThe funding plan is built on three pillars:\n\nThe plan includes measures taken to preserve liquidity during its roll-out:\n\nThe Group is committed to a strict capital allocation approach, with deleveraging as a priority, targeted investments, and suspension of dividend payments for the next two years.\n\nThe representatives of the reference shareholders approved this plan at the Board of Directors meeting on February 18 th , 2026, and committed to vote in favour of the resolutions necessary for its implementation.\n\nEramet will submit the appropriate resolutions at its next Annual General Meeting, in May 2026.\n\nRe S olution, the Group’s performance improvement programme\n\nIn December 2025, Eramet announced the launch of “ReSolution”, a programme of actions designed to improve its performance, unlock value and fully realise the potential of its world-class asset portfolio.\n\nThis programme provides a clear framework and rigorous methodology to drive the performance improvement initiatives and ensure their proper execution. The programme is structured around three pillars:\n\nThe ReSolution programme aims to deliver an initial run rate EBITDA 1 improvement potential of €130-170m within two years (at 2025 economic conditions), with full impact expected in 2028.\n\nThe programme also targets stringent capex discipline, with a positive impact on the Group’s FCF. Capex is thus expected to decrease by approximately 30 to 40% in 2026 (vs. 2025).\n\nThe Group’s safety performance remains in line with the CSR roadmap, as the TRIFR 6 stood at 0.8 for the year, below the limit set for 2025 (<1.0).\n\nHowever, Eramet mourns three fatal accidents that occurred at PT Weda Bay Nickel (“PT WBN”) during the year, as well as the death of a PT WBN subcontractor in January 2026 during a maintenance operation. The Group immediately implemented targeted safety action plans, in conjunction with the majority partner of the Indonesian JV.\n\nThe safety of employees and subcontractors remains Eramet’s top priority and Pillar 1 of the ReSolution programme – “Safety and positive mining” is critical. Its target is to record “zero injuries and High Potential Incidents (‘HPIs’)” while improving risk management processes.\n\nIn 2025, the Group’s overall performance for the “ Act for Positive Mining ” roadmap amounted to 105% versus the annual target (see Appendix 8), despite a safety performance at 0, due to PT WBN.\n\nThere were several notable areas of progress:\n\nAchieving the IRMA 50 performance level for Eramet Grande Côte (“EGC”) and the publication of EGC’s first external third-party audit report in February 2026 represent a key milestone towards delivering the Group’s Positive Mining strategy. This confirms the relevance of the IRMA standard as a framework for progress and transparency, as well as its credibility among stakeholders.\n\nEGC thus becomes the first mineral sands mine to reach this score and joins the 14 mining sites worldwide which have completed an IRMA independent audit 8 .\n\nThree additional Eramet sites are currently engaged in the IRMA self-assessment process. The PT WBN, Eramine and Comilog sites are preparing to enter the independent audit process, which is expected to begin for some of them by the end of 2026.\n\nThe SLB maturing in 2028 include two decarbonisation targets, with a coupon step-up in the event of not meeting one of the intermediate targets.\n\nIn this context, the intermediate target for the Group’s carbon intensity (scope 1 and 2) was not met in 2025 (0.267 tCO₂/t measured vs. 0.227 tCO₂/t expected). This is explained by the increase of the relative share of alloy volumes in the Group's total production. The intermediate target related to the value chain engagement was exceeded (72% measured vs. 67% expected). As a result, a 5 basis point penalty will be paid on the 2027 and 2028 coupon.\n\nIn 2025, Eramet maintained its A- score for the CDP Climate Change rating and obtained an A- score for the CDP Water Security rating, a significant improvement vs. 2024 (B). This result reflects Group-wide efforts across all sites to improve water management: increasing data reliability, developing water balance sheets for all sites, and gradually aligning water management plans with major international standards (IRMA, ICMM 9 ).\n\nThis recognition places Eramet among the most advanced companies in terms of environmental transparency, out of nearly 20,000 companies assessed globally in 2025.\n\nEramet's long-term credit ratings are B1 at Moody's and B at Fitch, both with negative outlooks. These ratings reflect the unfavourable commodity market environment, operational difficulties and balance sheet pressures, as well as country risk-related rating ceilings.\n\nEramet's Board of Directors met on 18 February 2026, chaired by Christel Bories, and approved the financial statements for the 2025 financial year which will be submitted for approval at the Shareholders’ General Meeting on 27 May 2026 10 .\n\n1 Data rounded to the nearest million or to higher or lower %. 2 Effective from 2024, the Group’s key performance indicators are presented excluding SLN, since the New Caledonian entity no longer impacts the Group’s financial and economic performance. Reconciliation tables in accordance with IFRS accounts are presented in Appendix 1. Definitions are provided in the financial glossary in Appendix 10. 3 Net of Tsingshan’s capital contributions to the Centenario project (€104m in 2024) and financing granted by the French State to SLN as a quasi-equity instrument (€257m in 2024, including interest accrued over the period, and €242m in 2025). 4 Restated for SLN’s net cash position on 31 December 2025 (€111m); as a result, consolidated net debt was €2,046m in the calculation of adjusted leverage. 5 Net debt-to-Shareholders’ equity ratio, excluding IFRS 16 impact. 6 Total shareholders' equity, net financial debt, site restoration provisions, restructuring and other social risks, less long-term investments, excluding PT WBN capital employed.\n\nN.B.: all the commented changes in FY 2025 are calculated with respect to FY 2024, unless otherwise specified. “H1” corresponds to the first half of the year, “H2” to the second half and “Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4” to the quarters.\n\nThe Group’s Adjusted turnover 1 amounted to €3,155m in 2025, down 7% from 2024. Adjusted for an unfavourable currency effect (-3%), the variation at constant scope and exchange rates 11 came out at -3% 12 , primarily due to an unfavourable price impact (-4%) 13 , which was partly offset by a positive volume effect (+2%) 14 .\n\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 amounted to € 372m , down 54%, reflecting:\n\nNet income, Group share, for the year was -€477m, including the share of income in PT WBN (€58m) and losses related to SLN (-€107m). Net income, Group share (excluding SLN) 1 totalled -€370m , mainly resulting from the decline in EBITDA and the limited contribution of PT WBN, as well as an asset impairment charge for the mineral sands activity (-€171m) – mainly linked to the weaker long-term price outlook in this market.\n\nCapex financed by the Group 15 amounted to €412m, down -17% vs. 2024, and include €235m in non-current investments, primarily in Argentina (€96m) and Gabon (€99m).\n\nAdjusted Free Cash-Flow 1 (“Adjusted FCF”) totalled -€481m . It includes the dividends received from PT WBN of €34m (in line with the strong decline in EBITDA), as well as tax disbursements of €137m, including €80m paid to the Gabonese State – corresponding, on the one hand, to the corporate tax balance for 2024, and on the other, to a tax adjustment for 2019-2022.\n\nThe “Cash Boost” programme, focused primarily on capex reduction, working capital optimization, and monetisation of CO₂ allowances in Norway, generated a one-off impact of €103m on FCF in 2025.\n\nUnder the SLN financing agreement signed with Eramet, the French State subscribed to €138m of undated fixed rate subordinated bonds (Titres Subordonnés à Durée Indéterminée – “TSDI”) at end-2024 to fund SLN’s cash needs in 2025. The French State has since subscribed €215m in additional “TSDI” (including €115m in December 2025), increasing total financing received to €353m to ensure financing for SLN in 2025 as well as the first part of 2026.\n\nThe Group’s net debt was €1,935m on 31 December 2025, after disbursement related to dividends paid to Eramet’s shareholders (-€43m) and Comilog minority shareholders (-€55m) in respect of 2024. Restated for SLN’s net cash position on 31 December 2025 (€111m), the Group’s net debt was €2,046m. As a result, the Adjusted leverage ratio 1 was 5.5x .\n\nAs of 31 December 2025, Eramet’s liquidity , including entirely drawn credit lines at end-January 2026, was €1.5bn .\n\nNo dividend payment will be proposed for 2025.\n\nWhile the SLN’s financial needs will once again be covered by the French State in 2026, a minority shareholder has expressed its intention to exit SLN’s capital and has requested Eramet to acquire its 10% stake for a symbolic amount in the coming weeks. Eramet has responded favourably to this request, which does not impact the Group’s economic exposure. This transaction is designed to preserve maximum flexibility as part of the work on SLN’s future.\n\n1 Data rounded to the nearest million or to higher or lower %. 2 See definition in the financial glossary in Appendix 10.\n\nEBITDA for the Manganese activity was €357m in 2025, (-37% vs. 2024):\n\n1 Turnover linked to external sales of manganese ore only, including €72m linked to Setrag transport activity other than Comilog's ore (vs. €66m in 2024). 2 Includes €52m linked to Setrag transport activity other than Comilog’s ore (€43m in 2024). 3 Definition updated (see financial glossary in Appendix 10), now excluding mining taxes and royalties (non-controllable), which account for 6% of FOB turnover.\n\nGlobal production of carbon steel , the main end-product for manganese, was 1,849 Mt in 2025, down 2% from 2024.\n\nChina, which accounts for more than half of global steel production, posted a year-on-year decline of 4%, ending at its lowest level since 2018. Conversely, India continued to see an increase in production (+10%), which was also the case in North America (+2%), benefitting from the protectionist measures introduced. Europe posted a further decline of 4%, faced with continued declining demand and continuing pressure from imports.\n\nManganese ore consumption for 2025 was up by 7% to reach 20.6 Mt-Mn, driven by demand for global manganese alloys production, particularly in China. However, with local steel production at its lowest level, this translated into higher levels of manganese alloy inventories among Chinese producers.\n\nManganese ore production increased to 20.8 Mt-Mn (+7%), strongly increasing in H2 (+12% vs. H1 2025). Production from South Africa (still accounting for nearly 50% of seaborne production) was significantly up over the year (+7%). In Gabon, volumes were stable over the year, in line with Comilog volumes. In Australia, volumes, which increased sharply, normalised in H2 (x4 vs. H1 2025), following the resumption of exports by a major producer.\n\nAs a result, the manganese ore supply/demand balance was in slight surplus over the year. Chinese port ore inventories remained at 4.6 Mt at end-December (stable vs. end-September), equivalent to 8 weeks of consumption.\n\nIn 2025, the price index (CRU) for manganese ore (CIF China 44%) averaged $4.5/dmtu, down 18% from 2024. This trend reflects unfavourable comparatives, given the strong price increases between April and June 2024. Prices slightly rebounded in Q4 2025, rflecting stronger demand from manganese alloy production in China.\n\nThe price index (CRU) for refined alloys in Europe (MC Ferromanganese) declined by 10%, while the price index for standard alloys (Silicomanganese) was down by 8%. Nonetheless, manganese alloys prices in European markets rebounded in December following the formal adoption of safeguard measures by the European Union.\n\nIn Gabon, the operational performance was heavily impacted in 2025 by logistics and operational challenges at the port of Owendo in H1 and on the rail network.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, volumes for manganese ore transported and sold externally came out to 6.1 Mt and 5.5 Mt respectively, representing stable levels vs. 2024, a year marked by historically low volumes. Rail transport remains one of the main bottlenecks in the logistics chain, highlighting the strategic importance of the ongoing investment programme to renovate and modernise the Transgabonese railway.\n\nIn parallel, production at the Moanda mine was up 4% to 7.1 Mt.\n\nFOB cash cost 2 for manganese ore activity was $2.4/dmtu over the year (+9% vs. 2024). This increase mainly reflects rising production costs, notably linked to the heavier reliance on a local logistics partner, higher maintenance costs, as well as an unfavourable €/$ exchange rate. Mining taxes and royalties (paid to the Gabonese State) stood at $0.2/dmtu in 2025 (stable vs. 2024). Conversely, sea transport costs per tonne were down to $0.7/dmtu (-31%).\n\nManganese alloys production totalled 653 kt in 2025, up 3%, reflecting the restart of production at Dunkirk smelter following the refurbishment of the furnace. Manganese alloys sales slightly increased (+1%), albeit with a less favourable product mix (52% of refined alloys).\n\nThe manganese alloys margin considerably eroded over the year due to the significant decline in selling prices (particularly in the United States) and the increase in the cost of reductants, while the decline in the price of manganese ore consumed only provided marginal respite.\n\nIn July 2025, Norway’s Ministry for Climate and the Environment ruled in favour of Norwegian manganese alloys producers, including Eramet Norway, regarding unfair treatment in the allocation of free emission allowances under the EU ETS for the 2021-2025 period. Additional CO 2 emission allowances were thus allocated to Eramet Norway for this period, enabling the one-off sale of allowances with a positive impact of €46m on alloys EBITDA in 2025, as part of the Cash Boost programme.\n\nGlobal carbon steel production is expected to moderately increase in 2026, with a less significant decline in Chinese production than in 2025, positively offset by an increase for the rest of the world – particularly in India where Eramet has a strong business footprint.\n\nDemand for manganese ore should decline in 2026, with the robust Indian production not sufficient to offset an anticipated decrease in alloys production in China. Manganese ore supply is expected to increase with lower comparatives in 2025, during which a major producer only resumed exports in May.\n\nThe market consensus, which is currently set around $4.8/dmtu 19 on average for 2026, with a lower H1 than H2, reflecting an increase of close to 6% in the manganese ore price index (CIF China 44%) compared with 2025.\n\nDemand for alloys is expected to increase slightly outside of China, in line with the growth in steel production.\n\nAfter a year disrupted by logistics challenges, transported manganese ore volumes are expected to be between 6.4 and 6.8 Mt in 2026. This increase will be delivered by ongoing railway renovation works and operational performance improvement actions spearheaded under the ReSolution programme. These actions serve to debottleneck transport capacity by optimising traffic, increasing the number of carriages per train and optimising maintenance. These initiatives will be supported by investments estimated at around €160m in 2026, of which around €70m related to logistics improvements.\n\nFOB cash cost 2 is expected between $2.4 and 2.6/dmtu in 2026, with the favourable effect of a volume increase largely offset by an unfavourable €/$ currency effect 20 .\n\nFollowing the announcement in 2025 by the Gabonese authorities of the intention to transform more ore locally, Eramet continues to conduct studies and discussions with the authorities regarding ore processing and value creation options in a robust win-win partnership approach. The objective is to swiftly establish a joint roadmap with the authorities that will enable value creation by contributing to Gabon’s industrial development as well as the viability of the associated economic ecosystem.\n\nManganese alloys sales are expected to remain stable over the year.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA (excluding SLN) 1 for the Nickel activity amounted to €95m in 2025 (-64% vs. 2024).\n\nPT WBN’s share of EBITDA (excluding the off-take contract) came to €102m (-62%), penalised by a less favourable product mix, the significant decline in the ore grade (-20%) and rising production costs. This decline was partly offset by significant premiums on the reference price (higher than 70% for saprolite).\n\n1 Excluding NPI off-take. 2 Supervision costs for the Indonesian entity.\n\nGlobal stainless-steel production , which is the largest end-market for nickel, increased by 2% to 62.6 Mt in 2025.\n\nProduction in China, which accounts for more than 60% of the global supply, also saw year-on-year growth of 2%, still driven by exports and domestic consumption. In Indonesia and the rest of the world, production was up 1%.\n\nGlobal demand for primary nickel increased by 4% to 3.5 Mt-Ni in 2025, driven both by the stainless-steel sector (65% for existing demand) and the batteries sector.\n\nGlobal primary nickel production was up 6%, reaching 3.7 Mt-Ni. Growth in the NPI 22 supply (+14%) and the ramp-up in new projects, notably HPAL 23 (+50%) in Indonesia, were partly offset by the decline in NPI production in China (-19%) as well as traditional ferronickel production (-5%).\n\nThe supply/demand balance (class I and II 24 ) remained in surplus in 2025. Visible nickel inventories at the LME and SHFE 25 increased in Q4 to 301 kt-Ni at end-December, equivalent to around 5 weeks of consumption.\n\nIn 2025, the LME price average (price of part of class I nickel) was $15,159/t, down 10% year-on-year, reflecting a market still in surplus. Conversely, prices significantly rebounded at end-December, in connection with a potential restriction on 2026 production and sales permits in Indonesia, the global-leading producer of nickel.\n\nThe average for the NPI price index 26 as sold at Weda Bay was $11,663/t, down by 3%.\n\nIn Indonesia, the official domestic price index for high-grade nickel ore (“HPM Nickel” 27 ) averaged $27/wmt for a grade of 1.6% 28 in 2025, declining by 10% (in line with nickel price trends at the LME). Considering the Indonesian government’s restrictions on permits, domestic nickel ore supply remained under pressure. As a result, premiums on top of the base HPM index price were sustained at a high level for saprolite (above 70% over the year).\n\nIn Indonesia , following an upward adjustment of the RKAB 29 in July 2025, nickel external ore sales 30 totalled 38.5 Mwmt over the year, up by 27%. However, this increase was accompanied by a less favourable product mix. Saprolite volumes sold accounted for 64% of the total, at 25.5 Mwmt, declining 11% year-on-year. To quickly market the volumes authorised by the revised RKAB, low-grade saprolite was sold as a supplement to higher-grade saprolite, thereby weighing on the average grade (averaging around -13%). Limonite volumes represented 34% of the total, at 13.1 Mwmt (x7 vs. 2024), driven by growing demand from HPAL plants in the IWIP industrial park. Internal consumption for the PT WBN NPI plant reached 3.4 Mwmt in 2025.\n\nPT WBN continued to benefit from significant premiums (more than 70% over the year vs. the HPM Nickel index) for its high-grade saprolite selling prices, against the background of domestic supply restrictions.\n\nParallel to this, production costs at the mine increased, reflecting lower productivity (notably, an increase in the strip ratio) and longer haulage distance. This was compounded by the increase in royalties, effective from April 2025.\n\nProduction at the PT WBN NPI plant increased by 17% over the year to 35.8 kt-Ni. As part of the off-take contract (trading activity), NPI sales stood at 15.8 kt-Ni, up 27%.\n\nPT WBN’s contribution to Group FCF was limited to €34m in dividends paid in 2025. This low contribution can be attributed to the substantial decline in EBITDA, amplified by a calendar effect tied to year-end sales (14.3 Mwmt over November and December, representing 37% of annual volumes), which will be collected in early 2026.\n\nDemand for primary nickel is expected to grow at a brisker pace in 2026 (+5%), notably driven by the development of stainless-steel production in China, India and Indonesia. Nickel consumption by the batteries sector should also accelerate.\n\nPrimary nickel production is expected to increase by 4%, particularly with rising NPI production in Indonesia, ferronickel and with MHP production stepped up for HPAL projects. However, the potential reduction of mining permits in Indonesia could reverse this trend and significantly impact production levels in 2026.\n\nThe nickel market started FY 2026 in surplus but could gradually rebalance depending on Indonesia’s strategy.\n\nFor 2026, the market consensus for LME nickel prices currently stands at around $15,750/t 19 , representing an increase of around 4% vs. 2025.\n\nIn early February, PT WBN received an initial notification from the Indonesian authorities to submit a RKAB application for an annual production and sales volume of 12 Mwmt of nickel ore in 2026 (including 3 Mwmt of internal sales). While remaining supportive of the market rebalancing policy pursued by the Indonesian authorities, PT WBN plans to submit as early as possible a request for an upward revision of this quota, which represents a disproportionate reduction for PT WBN. The initial RKAB granted in 2025 was 32 Mwmt and was subsequently revised upward to 42 Mwmt in mid-July.\n\nPT WBN will for now begin the preparation of this new RKAB and assess, together with local authorities, its subcontractors, customers and other local stakeholders, the necessary adaptations to its mining operations in response to this materially lower production level.\n\nUnit production costs per tonne of ore could increase compared to 2025, subject to authorised volumes and mining plan adjustment costs.\n\nIn this context of increasing pressure on local ore supply, the ore price premiums from which PT WBN benefits vs. the HPM Nickel reference price index, as well as the index itself, are expected to further increase compared to 2025, particularly in H1 if a structural shortage of ore emerges.\n\nDespite higher HMC production, EBITDA for the Mineral sands activity was €78m in 2025 (down 35% vs. 2024), penalised by a decline in prices which was especially significant in H2.\n\nThe zircon market remained in oversupply in 2025. Global demand decreased throughout 2025, impacted by macroeconomic uncertainty and the weakness of real estate activity around the world, particularly in China. In parallel, production over the year did not adjust sufficiently, notably owing to increased volumes of heavy mineral concentrates imported into China.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of persistent oversupply and the lack of prospects for a demand recovery in the short term, prices continued declining in Q4, leading some producers to reduce or cut their production.\n\nAs a result, in 2025, zircon premium prices averaged $1,668/t FOB, down 12% vs. 2024 (-8% in Q4 vs. Q3 2025).\n\nGlobal demand for TiO 2 pigments 32 , the main end-market for titanium-based mineral products 33 , was down over the year, also penalised by macroeconomic uncertainty and a widespread slowdown in consumption. At the same time, supply was only partly revised downwards, sustaining a surplus which significantly weighed on prices.\n\nThe market price for ilmenite (chloride), as produced by Eramet Grande Côte (“EGC”) was $274/t FOB in 2025, down 8%, factoring in China’s increased ilmenite supply.\n\nIn Senegal, EGC operations posted a solid operational performance for 2025. Mineral sands production achieved a record level, at 983 kt-HMC 34 , up 11% from 2024, driven by a significant improvement in average grade in the mined area as well as productivity gains delivered by the supplementary dry mining unit.\n\nConsequently, ilmenite production volumes increased by 8% over the year, to 617 kt, while ilmenite sales were up 4%, to 584 kt.\n\nSimilarly, zircon production increased by 5% year-on-year to 71 kt. Zircon sales totalled 65 kt, slightly down by 2%, owing to the postponement of certain shipments to 2026.\n\nDemand for zircon and ilmenite is expected at best to recover only slightly in 2026. Zircon production cuts and reductions implemented in late 2025 could enable price stabilization for this product in 2026 at Q4 2025 levels. In parallel, ilmenite supply would remain in surplus given the ramp-up of new projects, with average price levels lower in 2026 compared to 2025.\n\nIn Senegal, mineral sands production in 2026 is expected to be above 900 kt-HMC. The increase in the volume of sand processed and the productivity gains achieved under the ReSolution programme through the optimisation of the separation plant yield should offset the anticipated decline in the grade in 2026, in line with the mining plan.\n\nInvestments are underway to finalise an increase in production capacity and support the decarbonation of operations. A final tranche of around €30m is expected in 2026.\n\nEBITDA for the Lithium activity was -€51m in 2025, in the context of a delayed ramp-up in H1, before achieving capacity and output close to 75% of design capacity in December in only seven months of ramp-up.\n\n2025 enabled the Group to reach two landmark milestones: confirmation of the industrial efficiency of the Direct Lithium Extraction (“DLE”) technology developed by Eramet and the commissioning of the entire lithium carbonate production process.\n\nIn 2025, global electric vehicle (“EV”) sales were up 20% year-on-year. In China, sales increased by 17% with a sales penetration rate of 49% (+6 pts). Europe also posted a solid performance with a 33% increase in sales and an annual penetration rate of 28% (+6 pts). The United States saw modest growth at 1% over the year, with a stable penetration rate (10%), owing to the abolition of the tax credit to purchase electric vehicles, which was reflected in a slump in fourth-quarter sales. Installations of stationary energy storage systems (“ESS”) considerably increased in 2025 (+49%), driving cell production.\n\nConsequently, demand for lithium was significantly up over the year, reaching 1,533 kt-LCE in 2025 (+31%).\n\nParallel to this, lithium supply amounted to 1,558 kt-LCE (+18% vs. 2024), driven by the ramp-up in new spodumene mines (notably in Australia and Mali) and increased brine based production in Argentina. In China, with the notable exception of CATL's Jianxiawo mine, which was subject to intense speculation of a restart in Q4, all players affected by mining permit compliance issues appear to be continuing to operate as normal.\n\nAs a result, the Lithium market shifted from significant surplus to near-breakeven in 2025, owing to sharply accelerating year-end demand.\n\nThe SMM battery-grade index (Ex-Works, China) averaged $9,342/t-LCE in 2025, down 17%. However, the index rose by 20% in Q4 from Q3 2025, reflecting a rebalancing of the market at-end 2025.\n\nIn Argentina, Eramet’s Centenario plant ramped up its lithium carbonate production.\n\nOn the back of an H1 hampered by a technical issue during the commissioning of the Forced Evaporation equipment, production was substantially up throughout H2, reaching close to 75% of its daily nameplate capacity in December, vs. 10% in June.\n\nLithium carbonate production volumes totalled 6,690 t-LCE in 2025 (of which 5,980 t-LCE in H2). Given the priority given to ramping up production and the low price premium observed in the market, Eramet has decided to currently produce only limited quantities of battery grade, as the discount remains low compared to the cost savings. Volumes sold reached 5,420 t-LCE (of which 4,900 t-LCE in H2) and were made primarily to CAM producers in China.\n\nIn 2025, the plant’s construction capex amounted to €96m.\n\nGrowth in demand for lithium is expected to be driven by the continued adoption of electric vehicles worldwide. In China, the sales penetration rate should reach 60% in 2026, despite the gradual reduction in subsidies. In Europe, the 30% threshold is expected to be met. This momentum is propelled by the launch of 100% electric and plug-in hybrid models that are accessible to the general public, as well as the continuation of subsidies.\n\nGrowth in demand for lithium is also expected to be driven by the wide-scale deployment of ESS. China should remain the market leader, followed by the United States, Europe and the Middle East. The robust development of this technology is expected to boost demand for LFP chemical cathodes.\n\nThe price decline observed until end-June 2025 forced several lithium rock concentrate producers to cut or even halt their production, temporarily reducing the market supply.\n\nThe market consensus (battery-grade CIF Asia lithium carbonate) currently averages around $15,700/t-LCE 19 in 2026, up close to 70% vs. 2025.\n\nIn 2026, the Centenario plant will continue its ramp-up, reaching a level close to 100% by year-end (24 kt-LCE a year). As a result, produced volumes of lithium carbonate are expected to total between 17 and 20 kt-LCE over the year.\n\nParallel to this, and under the ReSolution programme, actions were taken to optimise cash cost, particularly by limiting input cost through improved reagent consumption. Within two years (2026-2027), the cash cost (Ex-Works, at nameplate capacity) is expected to be between $5,400 and $5,800/t-LCE (based on 2025 economic conditions), still firmly positioned in the first quartile of the cost curve.\n\nEramet continues to explore its development options for Centenario, with the salar’s overall production potential estimated at more than 75 kt-LCE per annum. As a first step, Eramet is actively studying options to expand the existing plant, located at the southern end of the salar, and retains a future option to build a new plant at the northern end of the salar. The Group is also assessing potential partnerships and strategic lithium development projects that would enable to leverage its now-demonstrated technical expertise. This growth strategy is designed to align with the Group’s priority being to pursue a deleveraging path while once more unlocking positive cash generation.\n\nAt the start of 2026, the macroeconomic uncertainties that weighed on demand across our markets in 2025 are being mitigated by favourable pricing conditions, with the exception of mineral sands.\n\nThe price consensus 36 and exchange rate 37 for 2026 currently stand at:\n\nTo reduce its foreign exchange risk exposure, the Group has implemented hedging on its EUR/USD exposure. This covers approximately two-thirds of its annual exposure and is in line with current Bloomberg consensus for 2026.\n\nIn 2026, manganese alloys selling prices are expected to face high volatility given the European Union's Safeguard measures and protectionist measures in the United States.\n\nDomestic prices for nickel ore sold in Indonesia, which are indexed to the LME and change accordingly, should continue to benefit from increased premiums versus 2025, supported by the context tension on Indonesian ore supply.\n\nSensitivities of adjusted EBITDA (excl. SLN) to the price of metals and to the exchange rate are presented in Appendix 6.\n\nIn 2026, freight rates are expected to be at levels comparable to or slightly higher than those observed in 2025, fuelled by rising demand combined with limited growth in supply. Energy costs should decrease in 2026, while reductants should increase slightly.\n\nThe ReSolution programme sets a framework aimed at delivering a run rate EBITDA improvement potential of €130-170m within two years (at 2025 economic conditions), with full impact expected in 2028. Most of this potential comes from the manganese ore activity, notably from expected volume growth. It does not include the lithium production ramp-up and does not cover Weda Bay.\n\n1 Definitions in the financial glossary in Appendix 10. 2 For an exchange rate of $/€1.20.\n\nThe capex amount 4 is expected to be between €250m and €290m in 2026.\n\n19.02.2026: Presentation of 2025 annual results\n\nA live Internet webcast of the 2025 annual results presentation will take place on Thursday 19 February 2026 at 9:30 a.m. (Paris time), on our website: www.eramet.com.

Outcome: 6.3% improvement in intrinsic efficiency vs. 2024 across all BUs (excl. SLN).\n\n1 CNFEOL (China FerroAlloy Online), “Other mining countries”.\n\nIn New Caledonia, SLN’s mining production amounted to 3.0 Mwmt in 2025, up 2% year-on-year. SLN’s mining activity remains heavily impacted by the closure of certain mining sites following the riots of H1 2024.\n\nSimilarly, SLN’s nickel ore exports remained constrained in 2025, at 0.6 Mwmt, down 12% versus the same period last year.\n\nSimilarly, SLN’s nickel ore exports remained constrained in 2025, at 0.6 Mwmt, down 12% versus the same period last year.\n\nIn 2025, nickel ore prices (1.8% CIF China), as exported by SLN, averaged $79/wmt, increasing by 8% from 2024. Ferronickel production totalled 36.3 kt-Ni (+10% vs. 2024). Volumes sold stood at 36.2 kt-Ni (+10% vs.2024).\n\nCash cost 2 of ferronickel production averaged $7.9/lb in 2025, down from the same period in 2024 ($8.8/lb). This improvement is owing to higher volumes and lower energy costs, despite an unfavourable currency effect.\n\nThe consolidated performance indicators used for the financial reporting of the Group's results and economic performance and presented in this document are restated data from the Group's reporting and are monitored by the Executive Committee.\n\nTurnover at constant scope and exchange rates\n\nTurnover at constant scope and exchange rates corresponds to turnover adjusted for the impact of the changes in scope and the fluctuations in the exchange rate from one financial year to the next. The scope effect is calculated as follows: for the companies acquired during the financial year, by eliminating the turnover for the current period and for the companies acquired during the previous period by integrating, in the previous period, the full-year turnover; for the companies sold, by eliminating the turnover during the period considered and during the previous comparable period. The exchange rate effect is calculated by applying the exchange rates of the previous financial year to the turnover for the year under review.\n\nAdjusted turnover is presented to provide a better understanding of the underlying operational performance of the Group's activities. Adjusted turnover corresponds to turnover including Eramet's share of the turnover of significant joint ventures accounted for using the equity method in the Group's financial statements, restated for the off-take of all or part of the business activity.\n\nAs of 31 December 2025, turnover was adjusted to include the contribution of PT Weda Bay Nickel, a company in which Eramet owns a 38.7% indirect interest. Eramet owns a 43% interest in Strand Minerals Pte Ltd, the holding which owns 90% of PT Weda Bay Nickel and is booked in the Group’s consolidated financial statements under the equity method. An off-take agreement for nickel ferroalloys production (NPI) is in place with Tsingshan, with Eramet holding a 43% interest, and Tsingshan 57%.\n\nAdjusted turnover also excludes turnover linked to the sales of nickel ore and others from SLN, as a standalone company, since the entity’s losses were fully financed by the French State in 2024 and 2025, following an agreement signed with Eramet. However, turnover linked to ferronickel trading is still booked in the adjusted turnover (under “Holding”), given the existence of a purchase agreement between SLN and Eramet S.A., and a sales agreement between Eramet S.A. and end customers.\n\nA reconciliation with Group turnover is provided in Note 5 to the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\nEBITDA (“ Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation ”)\n\nEarnings before financial revenue and other operating expenses and income, income tax, contingencies and loss provision, and amortisation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and tangible and intangible assets.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is presented to provide a better understanding of the underlying operational performance of the Group's activities. Adjusted EBITDA corresponds to EBITDA including Eramet's share of the EBITDA of significant joint ventures accounted for using the equity method in the Group's financial statements.\n\nAs of 31 December 2025, EBITDA was adjusted to include the proportional EBITDA of PT Weda Bay Nickel, a company in which Eramet owns a 38.7% indirect interest. Eramet owns a 43% interest in Strand Minerals Pte Ltd, the holding which owns 90% of PT Weda Bay Nickel and is booked in the Group’s consolidated financial statements under the equity method.\n\nIn addition, adjusted EBITDA excludes the EBITDA of SLN as a standalone company, since the entity’s losses were fully financed by the French State in 2024 and 2025, following an agreement signed with Eramet. However, EBITDA linked to ferronickel trading is still booked in the adjusted EBITDA (under “Holding”), given the existence of a purchase agreement between SLN and Eramet S.A., and a sales agreement between Eramet S.A. and end customers.\n\nA reconciliation with Group EBITDA is provided in Note 5 to the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\nEBITDA potential improvement for 2026-2027\n\nEBITDA potential improvement corresponds to an increase in the Group's EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA calculated for 2026-2027, with full impact expected in 2028. This potential is calculated on the basis of economic conditions in 2025, using Eramet's realised selling prices and the volumes produced and sold in 2025.\n\nCurrent Operating Income (excluding SLN)\n\nCurrent Operating Income (excluding SLN) is defined as Current Operating Income, restated for SLN’s operating income.\n\nA reconciliation with Group Current Operating Income is provided in Note 3 to the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\nNet Income (excluding SLN) / Net Income (excluding SLN), Group share\n\nNet income (excluding SLN) is defined as net income, restated for SLN’s net income.\n\nNet Income, Group share (excluding SLN) is defined as net income, restated for the Group’s share of SLN’s net income.\n\nA reconciliation with Group net income is provided in Note 3 to the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash-Flow is presented to provide a better understanding of the underlying cash generation of the Group's activities. Adjusted Free Cash-Flow corresponds to Free Cash-Flow net of (i) Tsingshan’s capital injection in the Centenario project for 2024 and (ii) financing granted by the French State to SLN (in the form of undated fixed rate subordinated bonds (Titres Subordonnés à Durée Indéterminée – “TSDI”) to neutralise the New Caledonian entity’s cash consumption.\n\nA reconciliation with Group Free Cash-Flow is provided in Note 5 to the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\nAdjusted leverage is defined as consolidated net debt, restated for the available cash provided by the French State (via “TSDI”) to finance SLN’s future losses, over adjusted EBITDA (as defined above).\n\nHowever, in the future, should other significant joint ventures restated for adjusted EBITDA have external debt, net debt will be adjusted to include Eramet's share in the external debt of the joint ventures (“adjusted net debt”). Adjusted leverage would then be defined as adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA, in compliance with a fair and economic approach to Eramet’s debt.\n\nManganese ore activity corresponds to Comilog's mining activities (excluding the activity of the Moanda Metallurgical Complex, “CMM”, which produces manganese alloys) and Setrag's transport activities.\n\nManganese alloys activity corresponds to the plants that transform manganese ore into manganese alloys. It includes the three Norwegian plants comprising Eramet Norway (“ENO”, i.e. Porsgrunn, Sauda, and Kvinesdal), Eramet Marietta (“EMI”) in the United States, Comilog Dunkerque (“CDK”) in France and the Moanda Metallurgical Complex (“CMM”) in Gabon.\n\nManganese ore FOB cash cost (new definition)\n\nThe FOB (“Free On Board”) cash cost of manganese ore is defined as all production and overhead costs (R&D including exploration geology, administrative expenses, sales expenses, overland transport expenses), which cover all stages of ore extraction through to shipping to the port of shipment and loading, and which impact the EBITDA in the Company's financial statements, over tonnage sold for a given period. This cash cost does not include sea transport or marketing costs and now also does not include the mining taxes and royalties from which the Gabonese State benefits.\n\nEx-Works cash cost for lithium carbonate\n\nThe Ex-Works cash cost for lithium carbonate produced by Eramine is defined as all the production and structure costs covering the entire extraction and refining stages required to make the finished or final product upon leaving the plant, and which have an impact on EBITDA in the Company's financial statements, over tonnage sold for a given period. This cash cost does not include land and sea transport costs, mining taxes and royalties from which the Argentine State benefits, or marketing costs.\n\nSLN’s cash cost is defined as all production and overhead costs (R&D including exploration geology, administrative expenses, logistical and commercial expenses), net of by-products credits (including exports and nickel ore) and local services, which cover all the stages of industrial development of the finished product until delivery to the end customer and which impact the EBITDA in the Company’s financial statements, over tonnage sold.\n\n1 Definitions presented in the financial glossary in Appendix 10 2 See financial glossary in Appendix 10. Cash cost calculated excluding non-controllable costs: sea transport, marketing costs, mining taxes and royalties 3 Based on a consensus €/USD rate of 1.20 for 2026\n\n4 Excluding the capex of SLN, financed by the French State 5 Revolving Credit Facility 6 TRIFR (Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate) = FR2: Frequency rate of accidents at work of Eramet employees, temporary staff and subcontractors (fatal + Lost Time Injury [LTI] + Non-Lost Time Injury [NLTI]), expressed as the number of accidents per million hours worked 7 IRMA: Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance 8 EGC and Eramet are part of the IRMA assessment system which includes 109 mining companies that have registered 132 mine sites, spanning 36 countries and covering 55 different mined materials. 9 ICMM: International Council on Mining & Metals 10 Audit procedures on the 2025 consolidated financial statements and verification work on sustainability information are in progress.

      "content": "The French banking group’s digital asset unit deploys EUR CoinVertible on a third public blockchain, alongside Ethereum and Solana.\n\nFrench banking group Societe Generale’s digital asset arm, SG-FORGE, has deployed its euro-denominated stablecoin, EUR CoinVertible, on the XRP Ledger, marking the token’s third blockchain launch after Ethereum and Solana.\n\nAccording to Wednesday’s announcement , the rollout is supported by Ripple’s custody infrastructure and could enable integration into Ripple products, including use as trading collateral. SG-FORGE said the move expands institutional access to the euro-backed token across another public network.\n\nThe launch comes about a month after global banking network SWIFT tested SocGen’s euro-pegged stablecoin in a pilot of exchange and settlement of tokenized bonds in both fiat and digital currencies. SG-FORGE said EUR CoinVertible was the first MiCA-compliant digital asset designed to integrate directly with SWIFT’s interoperability framework.\n\nEUR CoinVertible is backed by bank cash deposits or high-quality securities on a 1:1 basis. At the time of writing, there were about 70.51 million of the tokens in circulation .\n\nThe SWIFT pilot and multi-chain expansion unfold against a broader policy debate in Europe over the future of digital money.\n\nOn Monday, Joachim Nagel, Germany‘s central bank president, said Europe should advance both a retail euro central bank digital currency (CBDC) and euro-denominated stablecoins, arguing that domestic digital payment tools could strengthen the region’s independence in payment systems.\n\nEarlier this month, Nagel cautioned participants at a Euro50 Group meeting that a dominant role for US dollar–denominated stablecoins in Europe could undermine domestic monetary policy and weaken European sovereignty if euro-backed alternatives fail to gain sufficient market share.\n\nRelated: How Europe’s blockchain sandbox finds innovation in regulation\n\nThe European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCa) regime’s stablecoin provisions went into effect on June 30, 2024, requiring issuers operating in the European Economic Area to obtain an e-money license in at least one EU member state. The rules prompted several exchanges and issuers to delist or restrict tokens that had not secured authorization under the new framework.\n\nCoinbase, OKX , Bitstamp, Uphold and Binance were among several platforms that moved to remove or limit support for non-compliant stablecoins in response to the new the provisions.\n\nIn November 2024, Tether also announced it would wind down its euro-pegged stablecoin EURT , halting minting across all blockchains and giving holders one year to redeem their tokens.\n\nYet while many exchanges and issuers chose to leave the EU, others moved to align with the new rules. In July 2024, Circle became the first global stablecoin issuer to secure authorization under MiCA, a milestone that coincided with a surge in trading activity for its USDC token that month.\n\nMeanwhile, in the United States, the passage of the GENIUS Act in July 2025 has accelerated activity in the stablecoin market, with total market capitalization rising from roughly $260 billion on July 19 to about $307.6 billion, according to DefiLlama data .\n\nThe asset sector remains heavily concentrated in US dollar-pegged tokens issued by Tether ( USDT ) and Circle ( USDC ), which account for more than 80% of the total market cap.\n\nThe disparity in the market has drawn attention from European central bankers, who argue that strengthening the region’s own stablecoin ecosystem is key to countering growing dollar dominance in digital assets.\n\nIn December, BNP Paribas said it had joined nine other EU-based banks to launch a euro-backed stablecoin in the second half of 2026 through a newly formed Amsterdam-based entity, Qivalis.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin may take 7 years to upgrade to post-quantum: BIP-360 co-author",

Loading On the geopolitical front, as peace negotiations ended, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russia of delaying progress toward reaching a deal. Iran's temporary closure of parts of the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial global oil supply route, also added to supply worries.

      "content": "MKS ( NASDAQ:MKSI ) said it closed fiscal 2025 with “impressive execution” in a gradually improving demand environment, delivering double-digit sales growth, higher earnings, and expanding free cash flow while continuing to reduce leverage, according to management’s remarks on the company’s fourth-quarter and full-year earnings call.\n\nPresident and CEO John Lee said demand across semiconductor and electronics and packaging markets is strengthening as the company enters 2026, citing “ambitious CapEx plans announced by large chip manufacturers.” CFO Ram Mayampurath added that the company made additional progress on its deleveraging goals, including a $100 million voluntary term-loan prepayment in February and several financing moves intended to reduce interest expense and extend maturities. Get MKS alerts: Sign Up Fourth-quarter results topped guidance midpoints The 3 Favored Machinery Stocks To Buy In August For the fourth quarter, MKS reported revenue of $1.03 billion , up 5% sequentially and 10% year over year. Gross margin was 46.4% , and net earnings were $168 million , or $2.47 per diluted share , which management said was above the midpoint of its guidance range. Mayampurath said gross margin performance came despite “ongoing impact from higher tariffs,” higher palladium prices that are passed through at “zero margins,” and a higher chemistry equipment mix. Operating expenses were $263 million , slightly above the company’s guidance range, primarily due to higher variable compensation tied to stronger-than-expected results. Operating income was approximately $217 million (a 21% operating margin), and adjusted EBITDA was $249 million (a 24.1% margin). Liquidity at quarter-end was about $1.4 billion , consisting of $675 million of cash and cash equivalents and a $675 million undrawn revolving credit facility. Net debt ended the year at $3.6 billion , with a net leverage ratio of 3.7x , based on full-year 2025 adjusted EBITDA of $966 million . End-market performance: semiconductors, electronics and packaging, specialty industrial MKS reported growth across all three end markets in the quarter. Semiconductor: Revenue was $435 million , up 5% sequentially and 9% year over year, driven by strengthening demand in DRAM and logic/foundry applications. Management highlighted subsystems serving etch and deposition, along with continued momentum in plasma and reactive gases. Lee said NAND-related activity was stable sequentially, “as expected,” while orders remained robust in dissolved gases for advanced logic and in back-end applications tied to high-bandwidth memory. Electronics and packaging: Revenue was $303 million , up 5% sequentially and 19% year over year, primarily reflecting increased flexible PCB drilling and chemistry equipment sales. Mayampurath said chemistry sales were up 16% year over year in the quarter excluding foreign exchange and palladium pass-through. Specialty industrial: Revenue was $295 million , up 4% sequentially and 5% year over year, with improvement in research and defense and certain industrial applications, partially offset by softness in automotive. Lee said MKS outperformed estimated wafer fab equipment (WFE) growth for full-year 2025 and argued the company historically outperforms in rising spending environments because many products are “designed in” and because customers tend to build inventory during ramps. Full-year 2025: growth in semiconductors and electronics/packaging, softer specialty industrial For full-year 2025, MKS reported revenue of $3.9 billion , up 10% year over year. Semiconductor revenue was $1.7 billion , up 13% , led by plasma and reactive gases and vacuum products, with the service business described as a steady growth contributor. Electronics and packaging revenue was $1.1 billion , up 20% year over year; total chemistry sales increased 11% excluding FX and palladium pass-through. Specialty industrial revenue was $1.1 billion , down 4% year over year, which the company attributed primarily to industrial softness, including automotive. Gross margin for the year was 46.7% , down 90 basis points year over year, driven by tariff-related costs and mix, including record chemistry equipment sales. Mayampurath said the company mitigated tariff impact “largely” by the fourth quarter on a dollar-for-dollar basis, though tariffs are still expected to pressure gross margin by about 50 basis points . Operating margin was 20.7% , down 60 basis points , while operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved to 26% . Cash flow, debt reduction, and financing actions MKS generated operating cash flow of $645 million in 2025, up $117 million year over year. Free cash flow was $497 million , up 21% , despite increased capital expenditures. In 2025, MKS made $400 million of voluntary term-loan prepayments and followed with another $100 million prepayment in February. Mayampurath said that since February 2024, the company has paid down over $1 billion of debt. Mayampurath also outlined financing transactions completed in recent weeks, including a term-loan repricing (reducing spreads by 25 basis points on the U.S. loan and 50 basis points on the euro loan), an increase in the revolving credit facility size to $1 billion , and issuance of EUR 1 billion of senior unsecured notes. Based on current interest rates, he said the combined actions are expected to reduce annual interest expense on a run-rate basis by approximately $27 million . The company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share (about $15 million ) and said its board authorized a 14% increase in the next dividend, payable in early March. First-quarter outlook and key themes For the first quarter, MKS guided revenue of $1.04 billion ± $40 million , including: Semiconductor: $450 million ± $15 million Electronics and packaging: $305 million ± $15 million Specialty industrial: $285 million ± $10 million The company projected gross margin of 46% ± 100 basis points , with management attributing the sequential step down largely to mix and Lunar New Year-related seasonality, including lower chemistry sales. In response to a question, Mayampurath said mix should improve in the second quarter and further in the third quarter. MKS guided first-quarter operating expenses of $270 million ± $5 million , adjusted EBITDA of $251 million ± $24 million , and earnings per diluted share of $2.00 ± $0.28 . The company expects a tax rate of approximately 21% in the first quarter and 18%-20% for the year, and it expects capital expenditures to average 4%-5% of revenue through 2026. During Q&A, Lee said customer commentary suggested WFE growth could range from the “mid-teens” to about 20% year over year, while emphasizing visibility remains imperfect. He also discussed memory dynamics, pointing to heavy DRAM investment tied to AI demand and suggesting NAND could become a bottleneck, with potential upside from tool upgrades. In electronics and packaging, management said AI is driving higher PCB complexity and layer counts, noting that AI-related chemistry revenue in electronics and packaging grew from about 5% of chemistry revenue in 2024 to about 10% in 2025, with sequential increases through 2025. Lee also said the company plans to ramp its new “supercenter” factory in Malaysia in the second half of the year, describing it primarily as a business continuity initiative built in phases that will add future capacity and resiliency, while noting that supply chain execution—rather than factory space—typically determines constraints during industry ramps.

Lee said MKS outperformed estimated wafer fab equipment (WFE) growth for full-year 2025 and argued the company historically outperforms in rising spending environments because many products are “designed in” and because customers tend to build inventory during ramps. Full-year 2025: growth in semiconductors and electronics/packaging, softer specialty industrial For full-year 2025, MKS reported revenue of $3.9 billion , up 10% year over year. Semiconductor revenue was $1.7 billion , up 13% , led by plasma and reactive gases and vacuum products, with the service business described as a steady growth contributor. Electronics and packaging revenue was $1.1 billion , up 20% year over year; total chemistry sales increased 11% excluding FX and palladium pass-through. Specialty industrial revenue was $1.1 billion , down 4% year over year, which the company attributed primarily to industrial softness, including automotive. Gross margin for the year was 46.7% , down 90 basis points year over year, driven by tariff-related costs and mix, including record chemistry equipment sales. Mayampurath said the company mitigated tariff impact “largely” by the fourth quarter on a dollar-for-dollar basis, though tariffs are still expected to pressure gross margin by about 50 basis points . Operating margin was 20.7% , down 60 basis points , while operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved to 26% . Cash flow, debt reduction, and financing actions MKS generated operating cash flow of $645 million in 2025, up $117 million year over year. Free cash flow was $497 million , up 21% , despite increased capital expenditures. In 2025, MKS made $400 million of voluntary term-loan prepayments and followed with another $100 million prepayment in February. Mayampurath said that since February 2024, the company has paid down over $1 billion of debt. Mayampurath also outlined financing transactions completed in recent weeks, including a term-loan repricing (reducing spreads by 25 basis points on the U.S. loan and 50 basis points on the euro loan), an increase in the revolving credit facility size to $1 billion , and issuance of EUR 1 billion of senior unsecured notes. Based on current interest rates, he said the combined actions are expected to reduce annual interest expense on a run-rate basis by approximately $27 million . The company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share (about $15 million ) and said its board authorized a 14% increase in the next dividend, payable in early March. First-quarter outlook and key themes For the first quarter, MKS guided revenue of $1.04 billion ± $40 million , including: Semiconductor: $450 million ± $15 million Electronics and packaging: $305 million ± $15 million Specialty industrial: $285 million ± $10 million The company projected gross margin of 46% ± 100 basis points , with management attributing the sequential step down largely to mix and Lunar New Year-related seasonality, including lower chemistry sales. In response to a question, Mayampurath said mix should improve in the second quarter and further in the third quarter. MKS guided first-quarter operating expenses of $270 million ± $5 million , adjusted EBITDA of $251 million ± $24 million , and earnings per diluted share of $2.00 ± $0.28 . The company expects a tax rate of approximately 21% in the first quarter and 18%-20% for the year, and it expects capital expenditures to average 4%-5% of revenue through 2026. During Q&A, Lee said customer commentary suggested WFE growth could range from the “mid-teens” to about 20% year over year, while emphasizing visibility remains imperfect. He also discussed memory dynamics, pointing to heavy DRAM investment tied to AI demand and suggesting NAND could become a bottleneck, with potential upside from tool upgrades. In electronics and packaging, management said AI is driving higher PCB complexity and layer counts, noting that AI-related chemistry revenue in electronics and packaging grew from about 5% of chemistry revenue in 2024 to about 10% in 2025, with sequential increases through 2025. Lee also said the company plans to ramp its new “supercenter” factory in Malaysia in the second half of the year, describing it primarily as a business continuity initiative built in phases that will add future capacity and resiliency, while noting that supply chain execution—rather than factory space—typically determines constraints during industry ramps.

In response to a question, Mayampurath said mix should improve in the second quarter and further in the third quarter.\n\nMKS guided first-quarter operating expenses of $270 million ± $5 million , adjusted EBITDA of $251 million ± $24 million , and earnings per diluted share of $2.00 ± $0.28 . The company expects a tax rate of approximately 21% in the first quarter and 18%-20% for the year, and it expects capital expenditures to average 4%-5% of revenue through 2026.\n\nDuring Q&A, Lee said customer commentary suggested WFE growth could range from the “mid-teens” to about 20% year over year, while emphasizing visibility remains imperfect. He also discussed memory dynamics, pointing to heavy DRAM investment tied to AI demand and suggesting NAND could become a bottleneck, with potential upside from tool upgrades. In electronics and packaging, management said AI is driving higher PCB complexity and layer counts, noting that AI-related chemistry revenue in electronics and packaging grew from about 5% of chemistry revenue in 2024 to about 10% in 2025, with sequential increases through 2025.\n\nLee also said the company plans to ramp its new “supercenter” factory in Malaysia in the second half of the year, describing it primarily as a business continuity initiative built in phases that will add future capacity and resiliency, while noting that supply chain execution—rather than factory space—typically determines constraints during industry ramps.

(Photo by Kazuhiro NOGI / AFP)\n\nEuropean stock markets rose on Wednesday as traders assessed company earnings and economic data, while oil prices ticked higher following US-Iran talks. Investors looked ahead to minutes from the last Federal Reserve rates meeting for clues on the outlook for US borrowing costs. Tokyo’s stock market closed up one per cent after Washington announced a first tranche of investments by Japan following a pledge totalling $550 billion in a trade deal with US President Donald Trump. The commitments of $36 billion for three infrastructure projects came as Japan comes under pressure to deliver on its pledges made in 2025 in return for lower US trade tariffs. Elsewhere in Asia, the Lunar New Year holiday meant trading floors were shut in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Seoul and Taipei. London’s FTSE 100 shares index led European gains after data showed UK inflation eased in January, paving the way for the Bank of England to cut its benchmark interest rate next month, weighing on the pound. “Lower rates typically translate into weaker sterling which, in turn, flatters the overseas earnings which dominate the (FTSE 100) index,” said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould. Shares in BAE Systems jumped three percent in London after the British military equipment maker reported a rise in annual net profit and a record order backlog. London-listed shares in Swiss resources giant Glencore also rose as it announced a return to profit last year. Paris and Frankfurt stock markets gained in midday deals. The euro dipped against the dollar on a report from the Financial Times that Christine Lagarde would step down before her term as European Central Bank president ends in October 2027. An ECB spokesperson said Wednesday that Lagarde had not decide on leaving before her term expires. Oil prices rose one percent Wednesday as traders assessed negotiations between Washington and large crude producer Iran, as the countries met for talks on the Islamic republic’s nuclear programme. US Energy Secretary Chris Wright warned on Wednesday that the US will deter Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons “one way or the other.” Prices had fallen the previous day after Iran appeared upbeat following the talks with US officials, but Vice President JD Vance said Tehran had not yet acknowledged all of Washington’s red lines.

      "content": "The President of the German central bank has supported the use of euro-pegged stablecoins and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) to protect the bloc’s payments independence.\n\nOn Monday, Joachim Nagel, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, touted euro-pegged stablecoins and CBDCs as strategic tools for reducing the European Union’s (EU) reliance on the US dollar (USD).\n\nIn a speech at the New Year’s Reception of the American Chamber of Commerce in Frankfurt, Nagel highlighted that Europe has been affected by geoeconomic fragmentation , which has slowed the bloc’s economic growth and decreased competitiveness over the last couple of years.\n\nAs a result, the German Central Bank’s chief affirmed that Europe must take “decisive” measures to boost its economic dynamic, focusing on supporting the international role of the euro and making the EU “more independent in terms of payment systems and solutions.”\n\nHe highlighted the bloc’s efforts with CBDCs, noting that “Currently, the Eurosystem is working hard on the introduction of the digital euro – a retail central bank digital currency, or CBDC. This will be the first pan-European retail digital payment solution, based solely on European infrastructures.”\n\nAdditionally, Nagel emphasized the role of stablecoins, reaffirming that he sees merit in euro-denominated stablecoins for cross-border payments by both individuals and firms at a lower cost.\n\nLast week, he outlined the benefits of the fiat-pegged tokens at a dinner speech at the Euro50 Group meeting. The Bundesbank president noted that stablecoins open the door for programmable transactions and could facilitate cross-border payments by reducing the transaction costs and duration.\n\nHowever, he also discussed the potential European monetary policy challenges in the new geopolitical environment, including central bank independence and the rise of US-denominated stablecoins.\n\nAccording to Nagel, the rise of stablecoins could pose risks for the EU if the digital assets, particularly those denominated in a foreign currency, become widely used as means of payment and store of value in the euro area.\n\nHe noted that the US, under the Trump administration, has been promoting the development of the crypto industry by working on establishing a clear regulatory framework that protects customers and fosters innovation.\n\nNotably, US President Donald Trump signed into law the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, also known as the GENIUS Act, last July, offering a legal framework for issuers to operate within the US.\n\nSince then, the sector has seen strong growth, with its market capitalization rising nearly 50% last year from $205 billion at the start of the year to over $300 billion in late 2025. Nonetheless, most of the market is dominated by USD-denominated stablecoins, while the share of euro-pegged tokens accounts for less than 1%.\n\n“Thus, if this market composition persists, a hypothetical replacement of a domestic currency with stablecoins would be equivalent to a dollarization of the corresponding economy,” the Bundesbank Chief explained. “In this scenario, the effectiveness of domestic monetary policy could be severely impaired, not to mention that European sovereignty could be weakened.”\n\nNagel asserted that the risk of this scenario materializing is small, but added that authorities are exploring ways to leverage new technological opportunities to reduce its likelihood.\n\nHe advocated for a wholesale CBDC to allow institutional actors on financial markets to execute programmable transactions in central bank money. In addition, they could support DLT-based payment instruments not directly related to central bank money, such as tokenized deposits and euro-denominated stablecoins.\n\nTo him, “these measures will allow us to utilise cutting-edge digital technologies to maintain our monetary policy effectiveness in an uncertain geopolitical future. Additionally, they will increase our sovereignty.”\n\nFor updates and exclusive offers enter your email.\n\nRubmar is a crypto enthusiast who likes learning and improving constantly.

      "content": "European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde is reportedly weighing an early exit from the bank just as the EU enters a crucial phase for the digital euro.\n\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde is considering leaving before her eight-year term ends in October 2027, the Financial Times reported, citing a person â€œfamiliar with her thinking.â€�Â\n\nLagarde, who took office in November 2019, is said to be weighing an early exit ahead of Franceâ€™s April 2027 presidential election so that outgoing President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz can agree on a successor, the FT reported Wednesday.\n\nAn ECB spokesperson pushed back on the report, telling Cointelegraph: â€œPresident Lagarde is totally focused on her mission and has not taken any decision regarding the end of her term.â€�\n\nHer potential departure would come at a sensitive moment for the ECBâ€™s digital agenda.Â\n\nUnder Lagarde, the ECB has pushed ahead with preparatory work on a digital euro and repeatedly highlighted the need to manage risks from privately issued digital money , including stablecoins, within the new European Union Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) regime .\n\nECB officials have warned that rapidly growing stablecoins could pose financial stability and monetary policy risks in the euro area, even under MiCAâ€™s safeguards, and have argued for a strong market for wellâ€‘regulated euro-denominated stablecoins that can compete with dollar tokens.\n\nRelated: Digital euro key to payments sovereignty in â€˜weaponisedâ€™ world: ECB exec\n\nLagarde herself has been a vocal critic of Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other crypto assets, calling them â€œhighly speculative,â€� and saying in a 2022 television interview that crypto is â€œworth nothingâ€� and based on no underlying assets, repeating that sentiment even with BTC close to all-time highs in November 2025.\n\nA change at the top of the ECB could impact how the institution communicates on, and prioritizes, issues such as the digital euro, stablecoin oversight and crypto-related payment arrangements, even if the overall regulatory direction is set at the EU level.\n\nEconomists polled by the FT in December identified Spainâ€™s former Central Bank Governor Pablo HernÃ¡ndez de Cos and his Dutch counterpart Klaas Knot as leading contenders to replace Lagarde, with ECB Executive Board Member Isabel Schnabel and Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel also seen as potential candidates.\n\nAll four have taken cautious stances on crypto. In past speeches , HernÃ¡ndez de Cos has framed crypto assets and stablecoins as a financial stability risk that demands strong regulation and supervision, while Knot has called for a robust global regulatory framework for crypto and stablecoins.\n\nNagel has linked the push for a digital euro to safeguarding European monetary and financial sovereignty, and has called Bitcoin a â€œdigital tulipâ€� that is â€œanything but transparent,â€� warning against treating Bitcoin as a reserve asset.Â\n\nRelated: Cryptoâ€™s next battle is privacy, but regulators face chicken-egg dilemma\n\nSchnabel previously described Bitcoin as a â€œspeculative asset without any recognizable fundamental value.â€�\n\nThe digital euro project still needs the green light from EU lawmakers, while the ECB has moved into a technical preparation stage and is rolling out collaborations to ensure the digital euro is universally accessible to all.\n\nDespite rumors of a possible early departure of Lagarde, ECB Executive Board Member Piero Cipollone confirmed in a speech on Wednesday that EU coâ€‘legislators were expected to adopt the digital euro regulation in the course of 2026.\n\nHe said that would enable a 12â€‘month pilot in a controlled Eurosystem environment starting in the second half of 2027, with realâ€‘world transactions and a limited group of payment service providers, merchants and Eurosystem staff.\n\nThe Eurosystem aims to be ready for a potential first issuance of the digital euro during 2029, assuming the legislative process stays on track.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoinâ€™s â€˜biggest bull catalystâ€™ would be Saylorâ€™s liquidation â€” Santiment founder",

While Villeroy stressed that the rally reflects dollar weakness due to US policy uncertainty and has still left the common currency near long-term averages, he said officials are on alert.\n\n“The ECB does not have a foreign exchange rate target, but the exchange rate is obviously important for our inflation and growth outlook,” the French official told lawmakers in Paris.\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\nBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.\n\nA welcome email is on its way.

Financial markets have good reason to have less confidence in dollar assets,” he said.\n\nVilleroy once again struck a more dovish tone than his ECB colleagues, reiterating that risks of inflation undershooting the target are more significant than those of overshooting. He repeated his call for policymakers to remain “pragmatic” and “agile” when setting interest rates, which have been held at 2% since mid-2025.\n\n“Even if our monetary policy is well positioned, it cannot and must not be set in stone,” Villeroy said, also flagging the danger that a surge in cheap Chinese imports weighs on prices.\n\nCommenting on France’s own inflation — which has been running well short of the euro-area average for more than a year and stood at just 0.4% in January — he said the current rate isn’t too low and will probably average slightly more than 1% over the whole of 2026, once it overcomes temporary factors like energy costs.\n\nVilleroy also reiterated that his decision to step down early to run a charitable foundation for underprivileged children is a “personal decision with deep meaning for me” and has no connection to French elections next year.\n\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.
