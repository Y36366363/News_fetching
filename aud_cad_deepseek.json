  "output": "**AUD/CAD Analysis**\n\n**1. Key Market Drivers**\n*   **Risk Sentiment:** Mixed. Asian currency strength (News 6) and a weaker USD (News 7) suggest a modest \"risk-on\" tilt, which is typically AUD-supportive. However, the driver is new U.S. tariff threats, which create medium-term growth uncertainty.\n*   **Monetary Policy:** No direct data, but the slight uptick in Treasury yields (News 7) and a firming USD Index (News 8) reflect markets weighing delayed Fed cuts. This generally pressures commodity/risk currencies like the AUD more than the CAD.\n*   **Commodities:** The repeated gold price speculation in the provided \"AUD/CAD\" news is irrelevant noise. The real commodity driver is the **tariff news** (News 7), which threatens global trade and growth, negatively impacting Australia's export-heavy economy. CAD finds some offsetting support as a petrocurrency if tariffs spur economic uncertainty and oil volatility.\n\n**2. Short-Term Outlook (1-3 Days)**\n**Sideways to Slightly Bearish.** The immediate \"risk-on\" Asian FX move (AUD positive) from tariff headlines is likely to be fleeting. As the implications of broader tariffs sink in, growth concerns should weigh more heavily on the cyclical AUD than the CAD. AUD/CAD may struggle to find sustained upward momentum.\n\n**3. Medium-Term Outlook (1-2 Weeks)**\n**Bearish.** The prospect of escalating global trade barriers is a clear net negative for the Australian economy relative to Canada. Australia is more exposed to Chinese/Asian demand shocks from tariffs. Canada, while also trade-exposed, has a more resilient energy sector (oil price support) and direct trade ties to the US. This divergence favors CAD over AUD.\n\n**4. Trading Bias**\n**Bearish.**\n*   **Reasoning:** AUD is more vulnerable to a deterioration in global trade sentiment and slowing growth in key export markets (China). CAD benefits from relative US trade proximity and oil-linked support. The monetary policy backdrop (less-dovish Fed) is also a headwind for both, but typically impacts the higher-beta AUD more.\n\n**5. Main Risks / Alternative Scenarios**\n*   **Risk Reversal:** A rapid de-escalation of tariff rhetoric or surprisingly strong Chinese data could trigger a sharp risk rally, boosting AUD/CAD.\n*   **Oil Price Collapse:** A significant drop in crude oil prices, perhaps due to demand fears outweighing supply risks, would undermine the CAD's key support, potentially reversing the bearish AUD/CAD view.\n*   **Domestic Data Surprise:** Strong Australian employment or inflation data could revive RBA hike expectations, while weak Canadian CPI could boost BoC cut bets, supporting AUD/CAD."
