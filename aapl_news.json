  "analysis": {
    "deepseek": "**1. Key Market Drivers**\n*   **Sector Sentiment:** Negative pressure from broad \"Big Tech\" sell-off driven by AI spending fears impacting valuations (News 1).\n*   **Cost Pressures:** Rising memory prices pose a risk to gross margins (News 3).\n*   **Demand Signal:** Positive iPhone sales data in China for January, a key market, providing a counter-narrative to regional weakness (News 8).\n*   **Market Tone:** General risk-off sentiment indicated by bearish market action (News 6) and a shift away from former leaders (\"No longer the Apple of their eye\") (News 4).\n\n**2. Short-Term Outlook (1-3 Days)**\n**Sideways to Bearish.** The stock is likely to be tugged between negative sector momentum (Big Tech/AI fears) and its own positive China sales data. Immediate reaction will be dominated by the broader market's risk appetite. Expect elevated volatility and tracking with the Nasdaq.\n\n**3. Medium-Term Outlook (1-2 Weeks)**\n**Sideways with Downward Bias.** The positive China sales catalyst is a one-month data point and may be quickly absorbed. The persistent overhang of sector-wide valuation concerns and margin pressure narratives is likely to keep a lid on any sustained rally, leading to potential underperformance versus the market.\n\n**4. Trading Bias**\n**Bearish / Sideways.**\n*   **Reasoning:** The dominant market narrative is negative for mega-cap tech (AI spending fears, valuation reset). AAPL's positive idiosyncratic news (China sales) is unlikely to fully offset this powerful sector headwind in the near term. The stock is in a defensive holding pattern at best.\n\n**5. Main Risks & Alternative Scenarios**\n*   **Upside Risk:** A broader market rebound or rotation back into quality tech could see AAPL recover quickly, especially if the China data sparks positive revisions. Softer-than-expected inflation data (hinted in news) could be a macro catalyst.\n*   **Downside Risk:** Acceleration of the tech sell-off or negative pre-announcement on component costs (memory) would likely drive AAPL below recent support. Further deterioration in China macro data could also invalidate the January sales strength."
