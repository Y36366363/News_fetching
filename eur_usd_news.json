    "deepseek": "**1. Key Market Drivers**\n*   **Risk Sentiment:** Mixed. Positive from China reopening, but negative from renewed US tariff threats and geopolitical tensions (Iran).\n*   **US Dollar Dynamics:** USD is weakening due to a court ruling striking down some US tariffs and general tariff uncertainty.\n*   **Monetary Policy:** Not directly addressed, but a softer USD may reflect market pricing of a less aggressive Fed relative to other central banks if risk-off escalates.\n\n**2. Short-Term Outlook (1-3 Days)**\n**Slightly Bullish EUR/USD.** The immediate driver is USD weakness on tariff-related news (court ruling, Trump warnings). Positive Asian sentiment from China's reopening may provide a temporary risk-on tailwind for the Euro. Expect choppy trading within a 50-70 pip range, biased to the upside.\n\n**3. Medium-Term Outlook (1-2 Weeks)**\n**Sideways to Bearish.** The initial USD sell-off may fade as focus returns to the fundamental divergence between the US and Eurozone economies. Persistent tariff threats and geopolitical risks (Iran) could revive safe-haven USD demand, capping significant Euro gains. The pair likely consolidates or drifts lower unless Eurozone data surprises positively.\n\n**4. Trading Bias**\n**Short-term: Cautiously Bullish.** Medium-term: **Sideways with a bearish tilt.**\n*   **Reasoning:** Short-term momentum favors EUR on a soft USD narrative. However, the medium-term path of least resistance is lower due to superior US economic resilience and the Euro's vulnerability to risk-off flows stemming from the very tariff/geopolitical headlines currently hurting the Dollar.\n\n**5. Main Risks / Alternative Scenarios**\n*   **Risk 1 (Upside for EUR):** A rapid de-escalation of US trade rhetoric or a string of strong Eurozone data could extend the USD correction, pushing EUR/USD higher.\n*   **Risk 2 (Downside for EUR):** An aggressive escalation of US tariff actions or a sharp spike in Iran tensions triggers a strong flight to safety into the USD, overwhelming the current negative tariff impact on the Dollar.\n*   **Risk 3:** The ECB delivers unexpectedly dovish guidance, re-widening the policy divergence with the Fed and pressuring the Euro.",
    "openai": "**EUR/USD Forex Analysis**\n\n---\n\n### 1. Key Market Drivers\n\n- **Economic Data:**  \n  - Asia markets, especially China, are reopening strongly, signaling potential global growth support.  \n  - No direct Eurozone or US economic data provided, but positive China reopening may boost risk appetite globally.\n\n- **Monetary Policy:**  \n  - No new ECB or Fed policy updates in the news.  \n  - US dollar pressure noted due to tariff uncertainties and court rulings affecting trade policy.\n\n- **Risk Sentiment:**  \n  - Mixed:  \n    - Positive: China reopening lifts Asian equities, supporting risk-on sentiment.  \n    - Negative: Renewed US tariff threats and trade tensions (Trump’s warnings, tariff turmoil) create uncertainty.  \n  - Dollar weakening due to US tariff legal setbacks and geopolitical tensions (Iran).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Short-term (1–3 days) Outlook\n\n- **Outlook:** Mild EUR/USD upside bias or range-bound with slight bullish tilt.  \n- **Rationale:**  \n  - Dollar softness amid tariff/legal uncertainties and geopolitical risks supports EUR/USD gains.  \n  - China reopening boosts global risk sentiment, reducing safe-haven USD demand.  \n  - Lack of fresh Eurozone data or ECB signals limits strong directional moves.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Medium-term (1–2 weeks) Outlook\n\n- **Outlook:** Sideways to mildly bullish EUR/USD.  \n- **Rationale:**  \n  - Continued US trade tensions and tariff unpredictability likely to keep USD under pressure.  \n  - Eurozone fundamentals and ECB stance remain key; absence of hawkish signals keeps EUR gains moderate.  \n  - Global growth optimism from China reopening may support risk currencies including EUR.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Trading Bias\n\n- **Bias:** Mildly **bullish** EUR/USD.  \n- **Reasoning:**  \n  - Dollar weakness driven by trade policy uncertainty and geopolitical risks.  \n  - Positive risk sentiment from China reopening supports EUR and risk currencies.  \n  - No strong Eurozone or Fed catalysts to reverse trend immediately.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Main Risks / Alternative Scenarios\n\n- **Risks that could invalidate bullish bias:**  \n  - Sudden escalation in US-China trade war or new tariffs that sharply boost USD safe-haven demand.  \n  - Hawkish ECB signals or stronger-than-expected Eurozone data pushing EUR higher rapidly, causing overextension and correction.  \n  - US economic data surprises or Fed tightening expectations strengthening USD.  \n  - Geopolitical de-escalation reducing risk premium, leading to USD rebound.\n\n---\n\n**Summary for Traders:**  \nExpect EUR/USD to trade with a mild bullish bias near-term, supported by dollar softness amid trade and geopolitical uncertainties and positive risk sentiment from China reopening. Monitor US trade developments and Eurozone data closely for potential shifts. Use tight stops given mixed signals and potential for volatility spikes."
